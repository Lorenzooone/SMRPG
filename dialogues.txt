{0528}I:	 Sbrigati, Mario![1] Il Ministro ti sta aspettando.[0]
{0529}	 Mario! Please, you've GOT[1] to save Princess Toadstool![0]
{0529}I:	 Mario! Ti prego... DEVI salvare la[1] Principessa Peach![0]
{0530}	 I haven't seen Princess Toadstool[1] lately...What?![1] Bowser's got her AGAIN?![0]
{0530}I:	 È da un po' che non vedo la[1] Principessa Peach... Eh?! È stata[1] rapita da Bowser, DI NUOVO?![0]
{0531}	          Received “[26]”[0]
{0531}I:	          Ricevuto: “[26]”[0]
{0532}	 MY WALLET!!![1] Has anyone seen my wallet?![0]
{0532}I:	 IL MIO PORTAFOGLI!!![1] Qualcuno l'ha visto?[0]
{0533}	 I hope my grandchild turns out to[1] be just like the Princess![0]
{0533}I:	 Spero che da grande mia nipote[1] ami i fiori come fa la Principessa![0]
{0534}	 Mario![1] Let's say you and I get hitched in[1] a few years, okay?[3] Just[12][12]... give me time to grow[1] into my mother's wedding dress![0]
{0534}I:	 Mario![1] Da grande sarò tua moglie, okay?[3] Tranquillo[12]...[12]![1] Se arriva Bowser gli faccio una[1] bella linguaccia![0]
{0535}	 Hey, Mario![1] Look what you're standin' in![6]
{0535}I:	 Ciao, Mario![1] Fammi vedere un SALTO![6]
{0536}	[4][1]               HA! Gotcha![0]
{0536}I:	[4][1]               Oh! Forte! [36][0]
{0537}	 That horrible crocodile...[1] and wearing crocodile-skin shoes,[1] no less! Has he no shame?[0]
{0537}I:	 Oh, mi hai trovato![1] Cerca quel coccodrillo, ti prego,[1] fallo per noi![0]
{0538}	[1]      All I do is cook and clean![0]

{0540}I:	[1]     Gnam... gnam...[0]
{0541}	 One! Two! Three![1] Think if I practice enough I'll[1] jump as high as you, Mario?[2] [7]  (Sure!)[1] [7]  (Yeah, right kid.)[0]
{0541}I:	 Boing! Boing![1] Mario, pensi che con un po' di[1] allenamento, riuscirò a saltare[1] come te?[2] [7]  (Continua così!)[1] [7]  (Te lo sogni.)[0]
{0542}	 Mario! What a pleasant surprise![3] One of Frogfucius' grandchildren[1] is running errands in town today.[12][12][1] I haven't seen him, though..[12]..[12][3] Oh, you're here to shop?[6]
{0542}I:	 Mario! Che bella sorpresa![3] Uno dei nipoti di Ranitus è in[1] città.[12][12] Io però non l'ho visto[12]...[12][3] Oh! Sei qui per fare shopping?[6]

{0547}	 Hey Mario![1] My brother's waiting[1] for you upstairs![0]
{0547}I:	 Ehi, Mario![1] Mio fratello ti sta aspettando[1] di sopra![0]
{0548}	RAZ: Say hey, Mario![1] Guess what?[12]...[12][2] Raini isn't just a “friend”[1] anymore. We're getting married.[0]
{0548}I:	TOA: Ehi, Mario![1] Indovina un po'?[12]...[12][2] Toady non è più solo un'“amica”.[1] Ci stiamo per sposare.[0]
{0549}	RAZ: Yeah, she's right.[1] I guess we can put it off until[1] things cool down around here.[0]
{0549}I: 	TOA: Esatto, come dice lei.[1] Credo, però che non diremo nulla finché le cose qui non si calmano.[0]
{0550}	TOAD: Mario, there you are![1] I'll tell the Chancellor you're here.[2] I'll wait for you down the hallway.[0]
{0550}I:	TOAD: Mario, eccoti![1] Dirò al Ministro che sei qui.[2] Io ti aspetto nel corridoio.[0]
{0551}	[1]            This way, please.[0]
{0551}I:	[1]            Prego, da questa parte.[0]
{0552}	[1]                Hey, chill![0]
{0552}I:	[1]                Ehi, rilassati![0]
{0553}	[1]      Didn't I tell you to CHILL?![0]
{0553}I:	[1]      Non ti ho forse detto di RILASSARTI?![0]
{0554}	[1]        Sir, Mario has arrived![0]
{0554}I:	[1]        Il signor Mario è arrivato![0]
{0555}	CHANCELLOR: Mario![1] Thank goodness you're here! [0]
{0555}I:	MINISTRO: Mario![1] Grazie al cielo sei qui! [0]
{0556}	 We heard an explosion or something[1] at Bowser's Keep. It was so loud[1] I almost dropped my spores!!![0]
{0556}I:	 Abbiamo sentito un'esplosione[1] provenire dal Castello di Bowser.[2] Che rumore![1] Cosa starà tramando?[0]
{0557}	 Uh...excuse me? W...where's the[1] Princess? She departed for your[1] house HOURS ago...![0]
{0557}I:	 Uh... ehi? D-dov'è la Principessa?[1] È uscita per andare a casa tua[1] ORE fa...![0]
{0558}	 I fear the worst! Could Bowser[1] somehow be behind all of this?[0]
{0558}I:	 Temo il peggio! Che Bowser[1] sia la mente dietro tutto ciò?[0]
{0559}	CHANCELLOR: Spores alive!!![1] You're telling us that Bowser has[1] abducted the Princess AGAIN?[0]
{0559}I:	MINISTRO: Sante spore!!![1] Vuoi dire che Bowser ha rapito[0] la Principessa UN'ALTRA VOLTA?[0]
{0560}	 Things are ALWAYS happening to[1] her! What an UNLUCKY child![0]
{0560}I:	 Le succedono SEMPRE di tutti i[1] colori! Che SFORTUNA![0]
{0561}	 Nevermind. It will be up to you to[1] enter the keep and rescue[1] Princess Toadstool![0]
{0561}I:	 In ogni caso. È qui che entri in scena[1] tu e salvi la[1] Principessa Peach![0]
{0562}	CHANCELLOR: Egad![1] The keep is unassailable?! What[1] awful power is at work here?![0]
{0562}I:	MINISTRO: Poffarbacco![1] Il castello è inespugnabile?! E perché[1] mai?![0]
{0563}	 Mario...her life is in your hands.[1] Please, save our dear Princess![0]
{0563}I:	 Mario... la sua vita è nelle tue mani.[1] Ti prego, salva la nostra cara Principessa![0]
{0564}	[1]   We know you won't let us down![0]
{0564}I:	[1]   Sappiamo che non ci deluderai![0]
{0565}	[1]  So long Mario....and good luck![0]
{0565}I:	[1]  A presto, Mario.... e buona fortuna![0]
{0566}	TOAD: Where could the Princess be?[1] We're all counting on you[1] to find her, Mario![0]
{0566}I:	TOAD: Dove potrebbe essere la Principessa?[1] Mario, contiamo tutti su di te[1] per trovarla![0]
{0567}	[1]            Come back here!![0]
{0567}I:	[1]            Torna qui!!![0]
{0568}	CHANCELLOR: All we can do is[1] wait here. Don't let us down![0]
{0568}I:	MINISTRO: Non possiam fare altro[0] che attendere. Non deluderci![0]
{0569}	CHANCELLOR: On your way now![0]
{0569}I:	MINISTRO: E adesso vai![0]
{0570}	 Y, yes?...[12]Gee, you're soaking[1] wet, aren't you?[0]
{0570}I:	 S-sì...?[12] Caspita, sei fradicio,[1] vero?[0]
{0571}	 I'm all right now. Sorry...[1] There's nothing like a good cry![2] [12]But,[12] why was I crying?[5][6]
{0571}I:	 Adesso sto bene. Scusami...[1] A volte non c'è niente di meglio che piangere![2] [12]Ma...[12] perché stavo piangendo?[5][6]
{0572}	 Oh, no! That REPTILE[1] stole my Grandpa's coin![0]
{0572}I:	 Oh, no! Sono stato derubato![0]
{0573}	[4] B...boo hoo...sniffle...[2] I can't cry. Big boys don't cry.[12][1] But it's just not fair...![3][1] What am I gonna do? Waaaaaah!!![0]
{0573}I:	[4] Sob... sob... sniff...[2] Non posso piangere. I bimbi grandi non piangono.[12][1] Però non è giusto...![3][1] E adesso che faccio? Waaaaaah!!![0]
{0574}	 My Grandpa asked me to buy some[1] things for him here. When I walked[1] into town, that croc stopped me![0]
{0574}I:	 Mio nonno mi ha chiesto di[1] comprare delle cose per lui. Ma come ho messo piede in città,[1] un rettile mi ha derubato![0]
{0575}	 Oh yeah! He took it from me![1] He stole my coin! I chased[1] him, but he's way too fast...[0]
{0575}I:	 Esatto! L'ha presa![1] Ha rubato la mia moneta! Io l'ho rincorso,[1] ma era troppo veloce...[0]
{0576}	 Mario![1] Let's see how you're going[1] to take care of Bowser![6]
{0576}I:	 Mario![1] Fammi rivedere quel[1] tuo super SALTO![36][6]
{0577}	[4] Wow![1] He doesn't stand a chance![0]
{0577}I:	[4] È così che batterai Bowser?[1] Fooorte![0]
{0578}	 It was that reptile! He's the[1] one who stole my wallet...![0]
{0578}I:	 Colpa di quel rettile! Ha rubato[1] lui il mio portafogli...![0]
{0579}	[1] ...but I let him get away...[0]
{0579}I:	[1] ... ma me lo sono fatto scappare...[0]
{0580}	 Dunno what that reptile's up to,[1] but[12]...[12] MAN, can he JUMP![0]
{0580}I:	 Non so cosa trami quel tipo,[1] ma[12]...[12] CASPITA se sa SALTARE![0]
{0581}	 Wow! You're THE Mario? I know[1] all about you! You've got more[1] JUMP in you than a box of frogs![0]
{0581}I:	 Wow! Sei davvero Mario? So[1] tutto di te! SALTI meglio[1] di una rana![0]
{0582}	[4] I'm Mallow from Tadpole Pond.[1] I'm a frog, but can you believe it?[1] I can't jump. Embarrassing huh?[0]
{0582}I:	[4] Sono Mallow del Lago CràCrà.[1] Sono una rana, ma, ironia della sort,[1] non so saltare. Imbarazzante, vero?[0]
{0583}	[4] How about it, Mario![1] Will you help me catch that[1] filthy thief?[2] [7]  (Sure thing)[1] [7]  (I'm a little busy)[0]
{0583}I:	[4] Allora, Mario![1] Mi aiuti a catturare quello[1] sporco ladro?[2] [7]  (Certo)[1] [7]  (Ho da fare)[0]
{0584}	     The young frog, Mallow, who[1]      doesn't look AT ALL like a[1]    frog, joins Mario in his quest.[0]
{0584}I:	     Mallow, la giovane rana,[1]      che tanto anfibio NON pare,[1]    si unisce all'avventura di Mario.[0]
{0585}	 You're sure you won't reconsider?[2] [7]  (All right, I'll help you)[1] [7]  (Sorry)[0]
{0585}I:	 Sicuro di non voler cambiare idea?[2] [7]  (E va bene, ti aiuto)[1] [7]  (Mi spiace)[0]
{0586}	 Oh, please[12][12]...[1] Pretty please?[2] [7]  (Okay, okay...)[1] [7]  (NO!)[0]
{0586}I:	 Oh, andiamo[12][12]...[1] Ti scongiuro![2] [7]  (Ok, ok...)[1] [7]  (NO!)[0]
{0587}	[4] I never thought you'd be[1] so mean, Mario.[0]
{0587}I:	[4] Non ti credevo così cattivo,[1] Mario.[0]
{0588}	 Who cares if you can JUMP?[1] Being mean is soooo UNCOOL![0]
{0588}I:	 Chi se ne importa se sai SALTARE?[1] Non mi piacciono gli SFIGATI cattivi![0]
{0589}	MALLOW: You know I can't get my[1] coin back without your help.[2] [7]  (All right, already)[1] [7]  (No means NO!)[0]
{0589}I:	MALLOW: Sai che non riavrò la mia[1] moneta senza il tuo aiuto.[2] [7]  (E va bene, andiamo)[1] [7]  (Un no è un NO!)[0]
{0590}	 A lot of creepy looking thugs[1] have been sneaking into town...[1] Not on MY watch!![0]
{0590}I:	 In città sono arrivati molti[1] tizi spaventosi...[1] Ma non per colpa MIA!!![0]
{0591}	 Rain or shine, I stand watch![2] But this is getting ridiculous![0]
{0591}I:	 Che piova o splenda il sole, io da qui non mi schiodo![2] La situazione, però si sta facendo ridicola![0]
{0592}	 But this is getting ridiculous![0]
{0592}I:	 La situazione, però si sta facendo ridicola![0]
{0593}	[1] There was SOME reason[12][12]...[0]
{0593}I:	[1] C'era UNA qualche ragione[12][12]...[0]
{0594}	MALLOW: Did he look something[12][12][1] ...like[12][12]...this?[0]
{0594}I:	MALLOW: Il tizio era tipo[12][12][12][1] ... tipo[12][12]... così?[0]
{0595}	[1]          Why, yes! Exactly![0]
{0595}I:	[1]          Certo che sì! Esatto![0]
{0596}	MALLOW: He's the one who took my[1] coin! Why didn't you stop him?[0]
{0596}I:	MALLOW: È quello che ha rubato la mia[1] moneta! Perché non l'hai fermato?[0]
{0597}	 Because I forgot my bazooka[1] at home! [12]Sheesh...[12][12][1] [12][12]Give me a break, here.[0]
{0597}I:	 Beh, sai, ho dimenticato il mio bazooka[1] a casa! [12]Ehm...[12][12][1] [12][12]Ecco, dammi un attimo.[0]
{0598}	CROCO: Har, har! Youse mugs'll[1] NEVER catch me! A snail could[1] outrun YOU morons! Later![0]
{0598}I:	CROCO: Ahr, ahr! Imbecilli![1] Non mi prenderete MAI! Pure 'na lumaca[1] correrebbe più veloce di VOI cretini! Bye-bye![0]
{0599}	 Mario![1] I have something to report, sir.[0]
{0599}I:	 Signor Mario![1] Ho qualcosa da dirle.[0]
{0600}	 I saw him! He's here somewhere![1] He just zoomed past me a[1] second ago. Did you see him?[0]
{0600}I:	 Io l'ho visto! È qui da qualche parte![1] Mi è corso vicino[1] un secondo fa. L'ha visto?[0]
{0601}	MALLOW: That's HIMMMMM![1] Hurry, Mario, let's get him![0]
{0601}I:	MALLOW: Eccolo, è LUI![1] Forza, Mario, prendiamolo![0]
{0602}	 Rain or shine,[1] I shall fulfill my duty.[0]
{0602}I:	 Che piova o splenda il sole,[1] devo compiere il mio lavoro.[0]
{0603}	 Rain or shine,[1] I shall fulfill my duty.[0]
{0603}I:	 Che piova o splenda il sole,[1] devo compiere il mio lavoro.[0]
{0604}	[1]   I'll remain here on the lookout![0]
{0604}I:	[1]   Rimarrò qui di vedetta![0]
{0605}	 So I guess Princess Toadstool[1] really WAS kidnapped by Bowser.[0]
{0605}I:	 Suppongo quindi che la Principessa[1] Peach sia stata DAVVERO rapita da Bowser.[0]
{0606}	 You'll catch your death of cold![1] Come on, let's dry off.[0]
{0606}I:	 Ti prenderai un accidente![1] Asciugati, forza.[0]
{0607}	 But I wanna play outside!![0]
{0607}I:	 Ma io voglio giocare fuori!!![0]
{0608}	 Hey, what do you think[1] you're doing?![1] Get off of there this minute![0]
{0608}I:	 Ehi, cosa pensi di fare?![1] Scendi subito![0]
{0609}	 All right now, let's start again.[1] Go in FRONT of the counter[1] and talk to me.[0]
{0609}I:	 Okay, ricominciamo.[1] Vai DAVANTI al bancone e parlami.[0]
{0610}	 It's raining hammer handles and[1] pitchforks out there![0]
{0610}I:	 Là fuori piovono forche e manici[1] di martello![0]
{0611}	 Hey, Mallow![1] What kept you?[1] I was starting to worry.[0]
{0611}I:	 Ehi, Mallow![1] Hai avuto un contrattempo?[1] Mi stavo preoccupando.[0]
{0612}	MALLOW: Wait until you hear this![1] You see[12][12]...[12]...[0]
{0612}I:	MALLOW: Aspetta solo di sentire![1] Vedi[12][12]...[12]...[0]
{0613}	 Wait...I've already heard...[1] Old Frogfucius told me. He seems[1] to know EVERYTHING! Hold on.[0]
{0613}I:	 Aspetta... lo so già...[1] me l'ha detto Ranitus l'Eremita. Lui sa[1] TUTTO! Stai lì.[0]
{0614}	MALLOW: Listen...[2] The truth of the matter is, well,[1][12] ...um...[12]the coin was stolen.[0]
{0614}I:	MALLOW: Ascolta...[2] La verità è che, be',[1][12] ... ehm...[12] la moneta è stata rubata.[0]
{0615}	 WHAT?! [13][48]Well, if that's[1] the case, I guess we can't trade.[1] What a shame, huh?![0]
{0615}I:	 COSA?! [13][48]Be', se è così,[1] non potremo fare scambi.[1] Che peccato, eh?![1]
{0616}	MALLOW: Oh, but there's[1] no need to worry![1] Mario, here, will help us out![0]
{0616}I:	MALLOW: Oh, ma non c'è[1] da preoccuparsi![1] Mario, il qui presente, ci aiuterà![0]
{0617}	 'Zat so? Well, if Mario's on your[1] team, you'll have that coin back[1] in a jiffy![0]
{0617}I:	 Davvero? Be', se Mario è dalla tua[1] parte, riavrai quella moneta[1] in un batter d'occhi![0]
{0618}	 Not so fast! Take this with you.[1] You'll probably need it.[0]
{0618}I:	 Non così in fretta! Prendi questo.[1] Ne avrai bisogno.[0]
{0619}	[1]  Where do ya think everyone went?[0]
{0619}I:	[1]  Dove credi che siano andati tutti?[0]
{0620}	 Well, gang, looks like we have[1] ourselves a new home![0]
{0620}I:	 Bene, squadra, sembra che ora[1] abbiamo una nuova casa![0]
{0621}	 We can bounce around all[1] day long! And there's no one[1] here who can stand in our way![0]
{0621}I:	 Possiamo saltellare tutto il giorno! E nessuno[1] può fermarci![0]
{0622}	 Yahoo![1] Let's bounce the night away![0]
{0622}I:	 Evviva![1] Saltiamo per tutta la notte![0]
{0623}	[1]          NOT SO FAST, PAL![0]
{0623}I:	[1]          NON COSÌ IN FRETTA, AMICO![0]
{0624}	 Look at him! Can't even bounce![1] Hey, maybe we could bounce ON[1] HIS HEAD!!!![0]
{0624}I:	 Ma guardalo! Non sa nemmeno rimbalzare![1] Ehi, forse possiamo rimbalzare noi[1] SULLA SUA TESTA!!![0]
{0625}	MACK: Listen up, gang![2] These guys are gonna put[1] a stop to OUR party![2] Are we happy about this?![0]
{0625}I:	LAMO: Squadra, ascoltate![2] Questi qua vogliono[1] fermare la NOSTRA festa![2] E cosa diciamo ai guastafeste?![0]
{0626}	[1]         You're asking for IT![0]
{0626}I:	[1]         Ve la siete cercata![0]
{0627}	[1]       Ooh, you're gonna get it![0]
{0627}I:	[1]       Ooh, le prenderete![0]
{0628}	 You picked the WRONG people[1] not to bounce with, bub![0]
{0628}I:	 Amico, hai scelto le persone SBAGLIATE[1] con cui non rimbalzare![0]
{0629}	 How 'bout a fat lip to go with[1] that ugly mustache?![0]
{0629}I:	 Lo vuoi un bel labbro gonfio sotto[1] ai quei tuoi schifosi baffi?![0]
{0630}	CHANCELLOR: Mario![0]
{0630}I:	MINISTRO: Mario![0]
{0631}	 Once again, Mario to the rescue![5][6]
{0631}I:	 Riecco Mario al salvataggio![5][6]
{0632}	[4][1]         But who WERE those...[0]
{0632}I:	[4][1]         Ma chi ERANO quelli...?[0]
{0633}	TOAD: Chancellor![0]

{0635}	CHANCELLOR: First the Princess[1] and now THIS![1] It's just too much to bear.[0]
{0635}I:	MINISTRO: Prima la Principessa[1] ed ora QUESTO![1] Non ne posso più.[0]
{0636}	 Mario! Please! You MUST[1] rescue the Princess, NOW![0]
{0636}I:	 Ti prego, Mario! DEVI[1] salvare la Principessa E SUBITO![0]
{0637}	MALLOW: Mario![0]
{0637}I:	MALLOW: Mario![0]
{0638}	MALLOW: How about we ask my[1] Grandpa for help?...[5][6]
{0638}I:	MALLOW: E se chiedessimo aiuto[1] a mio nonno...?[5][6]
{0639}	[1] He knows...EVERYTHING![0]
{0639}I:	[1] Lui sa... TUTTO![0]
{0640}	             Could Mack,[2]    the sword-like monster who[1]  crashed into Mushroom Kingdom,[1]    have anything to do with the[2]  Star Piece that Mario found...?[3]    Our heroes move on towards[1]          the Kero Sewers...[0]
{0640}I:	                Che Lamo,[2]       il mostro-spada artefice[1]  dell'attacco al Regno dei Funghi,[1]    abbia a che fare con la Scheg-[2]    giastella trovata da Mario...?[3]    I nostri eroi avanzano diretti[1]        alle Fogne Rospofungo...[0]
{0641}	CHANCELLOR: Gracious![13][64][1] OH! It's YOU, Mario.[1] What a relief![0]
{0641}I:	MINISTRO: Oh, grandioso.[13][64][1] AH! Mario, sei TU.[1] Che sollievo![0]
{0642}	MALLOW: Mario![1] I'm in your debt, too.[2] Let's head over to Grandpa's place[1] in Tadpole Pond. He can help![0]
{0642}I:	MALLOW: Mario![1] Sono in debito con te.[2] Torniamo dal nonno al[1] Lago CràCrà. Lui può aiutarci![0]
{0643}	TOAD: Sir![1] Thank goodness you're all right![5][6]
{0643}I:	TOAD: Signore![1] Grazie al cielo sta bene![5][6]
{0644}	[1] Mario! So it was YOU who[1] got us through all of this![1] We owe much to you...![0]
{0644}I:	[1] Mario! Ci hai condotto TU[1] alla salvezza![1] Te ne siamo debitori...![0]
{0645}	CHANCELLOR: Excuse me, but...[1] who are YOU?[0]
{0645}I:	MINISTRO: Mi scusi, ma...[1] LEI chi sarebbe?[0]
{0646}	MALLOW: Oh, hello![1] My name is Mallow. I'm from[1] Tadpole Pond...[0]
{0646}I:	MALLOW: Oh, salve![1] Sono Mallow. Vivo presso il[1] Lago CràCrà...[0]
{0647}	CHANCELLOR: Well, any friend of[1] Mario's is welcome here in[1] Mushroom Kingdom.[5][6]
{0647}I:	MINISTRO: Be', tutti gli amici di[1] Mario sono benvenuti nel[1] Regno dei Funghi.[5][6]
{0648}	[4] As I was saying, Mario, you[1] are our only hope![0]
{0648}I:	[4] Come dicevo, Mario, sei la[1] nostra unica speranza![0]
{0649}	 Help!![0]
{0649}I:	 Aiuto!!![0]
{0650}	 I'm guarding the Treasure Room.[1] Sorry, but you'll have to get the[1] Chancellor's permission to pass.[0]
{0650}I:	 Faccio la guardia al Magazzino.[1] Mi spiace, ma per passare devi[1] avere il permesso del Ministro.[0]
{0651}	[1]         Hey, HEY! wrong way.[0]
{0651}I:	[1]         Ehi, EHI! Strada sbagliata.[0]
{0652}	 Oh, I found this in the cellar.[1] Here, you can have it.[0]
{0652}I:	 Oh, ho trovato questo in cantina.[1] Ecco, puoi averlo.[0]
{0653}	 Oh, I found this in the cellar.[1] Here, you can have it.[0]
{0653}I:	 Oh, ho trovato questo in cantina.[1] Ecco, puoi averlo.[0]
{0654}	 Oh, I found this in the cellar.[1] Here, you can have it.[0]
{0654}I:	 Oh, ho trovato questo in cantina.[1] Ecco, puoi averlo.[0]
{0655}	 I guard the vault.[1] No one takes our treasure![0]
{0655}I:	 Faccio la guardia al Magazzino.[1] Nessuno ruba il nostro tesoro![0]
{0656}	 That Vault...Guard![1] I come here to save him and[1] he runs into the next room![2] Well, so much for him.[0]
{0656}I:	 La Guardia del... Magazzino![1] Vengo a salvarlo e[1] lui scappa di là![2] Bah, contento lui...[0]
{0657}	[1]               I'm scared![0]
{0657}I:	[1]               Che paura![0]
{0658}	 What ARE those things[1] out there, anyway?![0]
{0658}I:	 E comunque cosa SONO[1] quei cosi là fuori?![0]
{0659}	 OH NO![1] The Chancellor's still in the[1] throne room![0]
{0659}I:	 OH NO![1] Il Ministro è ancora nella[1] sala del trono![0]
{0660}	[1]  I'm too scared to pass by them![0]
{0660}I:	[1] Ho troppa paura per passargli vicino![0]
{0661}	[1]             Trapped again![0]
{0661}I:	[1]             Sono in trappola![0]
{0662}	 Saved by Mario again! How could[1] I ever thank you enough?![0]
{0662}I:	 Salvato di nuovo da Mario! Come[1] posso ringraziarti?![0]
{0663}	 You're in one piece![0]
{0663}I:	 Sei tutto intero![0]
{0664}	TOAD: Thanks to Mario, of course![0]
{0664}I:	TOAD: Grazie a Mario, ovviamente![0]
{0665}	TOAD: What?! That's terrible![0]
{0665}I:	TOAD: Cosa?! È terribile![0]
{0666}	 But, with Mario around,[12]...[1] we're...[12]safe, right?[2] [7]  (You bet)[1] [7]  (I wouldn't be so sure)[0]
{0666}I:	 Ma con Mario dalla nostra[12]...[1] siamo...[12]salvi, giusto?[2] [7]  (Puoi contarci)[1] [7]  (Non ne sarei così sicuro)[0]
{0667}	TOAD: (gasping)...Mario..[1] I'm..sorry I'm...late. I was [1] caught up...in some business.[3] So, shall we head off to the[1] Chancellor's place now?[0]
{0667}I:	TOAD: Anf... Mario...[1] Mi scuso... del... ritardo. Sono stato[1] colto da... un imprevisto.[3] Dunque, adesso dovremmo andare[1] dal Ministro?[0]
{0668}	 That was TOO darn close.[1] Thanks for the hand, Mario.[0]
{0668}I:	 Per un PELO.[1] Grazie dell'aiuto, Mario.[0]
{0669}	 Hey! THAT'S the wallet the[1] crocodile swiped from me![1] Can I have it back?[2] [7]  (Sure)[1] [7]  (No way)[0]
{0669}I:	 Ehi! QUELLO è il portafogli[1] che il coccodrillo m'ha scippato![1] Posso riaverlo?[2] [7]  (Certo)[1] [7]  (Mai!)[0]
{0670}	[4][1]     Why, you're as bad as he is![0]
{0670}I:	[4][1]     Certo che sei peggio di lui![0]
{0671}	[4] Thank you so much! Here,[1] I'll give you this as a reward.[1] Go on now, take it.[0]
{0671}I:	[4] Grazie mille! Ecco,[1] ti darò questo come ricompensa.[1] Avanti, prendi.[0]
{0672}	 Hey, give me back my wallet![2] [7]  (All right, quit whining)[1] [7]  (NO WAY, Jose!)[0]
{0672}I:	 Ehi, ridammi il mio portafogli![2] [7]  (Ok, ma smetti di frignare)[1] [7]  (TE LO SCORDI!)[0]
{0673}	 There's a lot of noise out there[1] today.[0]
{0673}I:	 Oggi c'è un bel viavai.[0]
{0674}	[1]               Oh, wow...![0]
{0674}I:	[1]               Oh, wow...![0]
{0675}	[1]     I'm shaken, but not stirred![0]
{0675}I:	[1]     Mi piego, ma non mi spezzo![0]
{0676}	 It's scary outside, so let's play[1] indoors, all right?[0]
{0676}I:	 È pericoloso andare fuori, perciò[1] giochiamo dentro, ok?[0]
{0677}	 It's so nice to see our young ones[1] having a good time![0]
{0677}I:	 È così bello vedere giovani[1] forti e sprizzanti![0]
{0678}	RAINI: Do you happen to know of[1] a good wedding chapel?[0]
{0678}I:	TOADY: Non è che per caso conosci[1] una buona chiesa per sposarci?[0]
{0679}	RAINI: I found the perfect place[1] for a wedding! But now we're all[1] stuck inside![0]
{0679}I:	TOADY: Ho trovato il posto perfetto[1] per un matrimonio! Ma ora[1] siamo tutti bloccati qua![0]
{0680}	[1]           Thank you, Mario![0]
{0680}I:	[1]           Grazie, Mario![0]
{0681}	 I just can't get this meal to look[1] like the picture in my cookbook.[0]
{0681}I:	 Questa pietanza non[1] è venuta come nell'immagine del ricettario.[0]
{0682}	 You may NOT sleep in the Princess'[1] bed. Have you no manners?[0]
{0682}I:	 NON dovresti dormire nel letto della[1] Principessa. Un po' di buone maniere, no?[0]
{0683}	MALLOW: Hey, mister![5][1] I got my coin back![0]
{0683}I:	MALLOW: Ehi, signore![5][1] Ho riavuto la mia moneta![0]
{0684}	 Oh! Well DONE, lad![1] Okay, here's the thing[1] I promised you...[0]
{0684}I:	 Oh! Ben FATTO, ragazzo![0] Ok, ecco qua.[1] Come promesso...[0]
{0685}	 There! Make sure it doesn't get[1] stolen, eaten, or...whatever![1] Your Grandpa needs it, okay?[0]
{0685}I:	 Prendi! E vedi di non fartela rubare,[1] mangiare o... vabbè, hai capito![1] Tuo Nonno ne ha bisogno, ok?[0]
{0686}	MALLOW: You bet![5][6]
{0686}I:	MALLOW: Ci conti![5][6]
{0687}	 Excuse me?![3] You want to...WHAT? How can[1] you shop at a time like this?![3] Just...take what you want and[1] leave some money behind...[0]
{0687}I:	 Mi scusi?![3] COSA ha intenzione di fare? Come può[1] fare spese a quest'ora?![3] Va bene... prendi quello che vuoi e[1] lascia qui i soldi...[0]
{0688}	 The Princess hasn't returned yet.[1] Can you imagine how the[2] Chancellor must feel?[0]
{0688}I:	 La Principessa non è ancora tornata.[1] Non capisci quanto io[2] e il Ministro siamo preoccupati?[0]
{0689}	 I'm shaken and stirred but still[1] standing.[0]
{0689}I:	 Mi piego e mi spezzo ma non[1] cado.[0]
{0690}	 The Vault Guard better not be[1] goofing off while I'm cleaning[1] the guest room![0]
{0690}I:	 La Guardia del Magazzino farà[1] meglio a non battere la fiacca[1] mentre io pulisco la[1] camera degli ospiti![0]
{0691}	 Thanks, Mario. I'll continue to[1] stand watch, but now EVERYONE[1] seems suspicious![2] By the way, look what I found.[0]
{0691}I:	 Grazie, Mario. Continuerò a[1] fare da guardia, ma ora sembrano[1] TUTTI sospetti![2] A proposito, guarda cos'ho trovato.[0]
{0692}	[1]            Thanks, Mario![0]
{0692}I:	[1]            Grazie, Mario![0]
{0693}	 Boing, boing, boing![1] Now THIS guy can JUMP![0]
{0693}I:	 Boing, boing, boing![1] QUESTO sì che è un SALTO![0]
{0694}	[1]     I can still jump the highest![0]
{0694}I:	[1]     Sono ancora il più bravo a saltare![0]
{0695}	 So, what did you find?[0]
{0695}I:	 Allora, cosa hai scoperto?[0]
{0696}	[1]            This way, please.[0]
{0696}I:	[1]            Prego, di questa parte.[0]
{0697}	[1]     Hope my little brother is OK.[0]
{0697}I:	[1]     Spero che mio fratellino stia bene.[0]
{0698}	 There we go, now! Hey wait...[2] Hang on for a sec, okay?[0]
{0698}I:	 Oh, bene! Ehi aspetta...[2] Un secondo![0]
{0699}	TOAD: Please take this.[1] The Princess would be happy to[1] know you have something of hers.[0]
{0699}I:	TOAD: Ecco, prendi.[1] La Principessa sarebbe felice di[1] sapere che hai un suo ricordo.[0]
{0700}	            Gained 1 Flower![0]
{0700}I:	            Ottenuto: 1 Fiore![0]
{0701}	 Yeah, you're right...[1] I'm asking for too much...[0]
{0701}I:	 Sì, hai ragione...[1] Forse pretendo un po' troppo...[0]
{0702}	TOAD: Good luck, Mario![1] Give 'em heck![0]
{0702}I:	TOAD: Buona fortuna, Mario![1] Fagli vedere chi sei![0]
{0703}	[1]  But what about my son upstairs?[0]
{0703}I:	[1]  E che mi dici di mio figlio, che è di sopra?[0]
{0704}	 Oops![13][48][1] I forgot all about him![0]
{0704}I:	 Oops![13][48][1] Mi ero scordata![0]
{0705}	[1]   I'm really worried about my son.[0]
{0705}I:	[1]   Sono molto preoccupata per lui.[0]
{0706}	 Really, thank you so much for[1] EVERYTHING![0]
{0706}I:	 Davvero, grazie di TUTTO![0]
{0707}	 You're going to grow up to be just[1] like Mario, you hear?[0]
{0707}I:	 Da grande sarai come Mario,[1] capito?[0]
{0708}	[1]            This is not good![0]
{0708}I:	[1]            Si mette male![0]
{0709}	[1]    The mustachioed one is strong![0]
{0709}I:	[1]    Il baffetto è forte![0]
{0710}	[1]             Strong, YES![0]
{0710}I:	[1]             SÌ, è forte![0]
{0711}	[1]       We MUST warn the boss![0]
{0711}I:	[1]       DOBBIAMO avvertire il capo![0]
{0712}	[1]                Come on!![0]
{0712}I:	[1]                Andiamo!!![0]
{0713}	[1]            Chop chop chop...[0]
{0713}I:	[1]            Chop chop chop...[0]
{0714}	 Hurry and find the Princess![1] We're getting too stressed out![0]
{0714}I:	 Sbrigati a trovare la Principessa![1] C'è tensione nell'aria![0]
{0715}	 The Princess' room is up ahead.[1] Don't you go snooping through[1] her things, though.[0]
{0715}I:	 La stanza della Principessa è qui di fronte.[1] Ma vedi di non ficcare[1] il naso tra le sue cose.[0]
{0716}	        Found Toadstool's ???[0]
{0716}I:	        Ottenuto: [154][154][154] di Peach[0]
{0717}	 Hey there!![1] What do you think you're doing?[0]
{0717}I:	 Fermo!!![1] Cosa pensi di fare?[0]
{0718}	 The Princess' room is up ahead.[1] Were you caught trying to steal[1] something?[2] [7]  (Are you kidding?!)[1] [7]  (How did you know?)[0]
{0718}I:	 La stanza delle Principessa è qui di fronte.[1] Ti hanno colto in flagrante mentre[1] rubavi qualcosa?[2][2] [7]  (Tu scherzi, vero?!)[1] [7]  (Come fai a saperlo?!)
{0719}	[4] You musn't lie.[1] I know what you've been up to.[0]
{0719}I:	[4] Non mentire.[1] So cosa stai tramando.[0]
{0720}	[4] Honesty is one of your finest[1] qualities, Mario.[0]
{0720}I:	[4] L'onestà è una[1] delle tue qualità migliori, Mario.[0]
{0721}	 I'll give you this in exchange.[1] Just leave everything[1] where it was![0]
{0721}I:	 In cambio, ti darò questo.[1] Basta che lasci tutto[1] come l'hai trovato![0]
{0722}	 Let's refrain from searching[1] through other peoples' things![0]
{0722}I:	 Cerchiamo di non ficcare il[1] naso nelle cose altrui![0]
{0723}	 It doesn't seem like the Princess[1] is THAT far away.[1] I can almost feel her presence.[0]
{0723}I:	 Non sembra che la Principessa[1] sia MOLTO lontano.[1] Posso quasi sentire la sua presenza.[0]
{0724}	 Was the Princess kidnapped by[1] those THINGS outside?[1] Are THEY a part of this?[0]
{0724}I:	 Che la Principessa sia stata[1] rapita da quei COSI?[1] 
{0725}	 Help the people in the castle, and[1] they just might help you![0]
{0725}I:	 Se aiuti gli abitanti del castello,[1] loro potrebbero ricambiare![0]
{0726}	 Trample the monsters![1] Smash 'em all! It'll do ya good.[2] Trust me[5]...on THIS ONE.[0]
{0726}I:	 Calpesta i nemici![1] Schiacciali tutti! Ti senirai meglio.[2] Fidati di me[5]... per UNA VOLTA.[0]

{0749}	 Well, you have the hat...[1] AND the funky 'stache...![1] Are you really Mario?![2] [7]  (You betcha!)[1] [7]  (Wrong number!)[0]
{0749}I:	 Beh, hai cappello...[1] E baffi...![1] Sei davvero Mario?![2] [7]  (Proprio così!)[1] [7]  (Ritenta!)[0]
{0750}	[4] How do I know it's you?[1] You might just be pulling my leg![2] Show me! PROVE IT![6]
{0750}I:	[4] Come faccio a sapere che sei tu?![1] Potrebbe essere una farsa![2] Dimostramelo! VOGLIO LE PROVE![6]
{0751}	[4] All right!![2] Hey Mario, wanna play with me?[1] I'm playing “Save the world!”[0]
{0751}I:	[4] Uao!!![2] Ehi, Mario, vuoi giocare con me?[1] Facciamo “Salva il mondo”![0]
{0752}	[4] Awwww, you're a fake.[2] Well, you'll have to do...[2] Let's play my[12]...[12]“Geno” game![0]
{0752}I:	[4] Awwww, sei un falso.[2] Allora, dovrai...[2] Giocare a[12]...[12] “Geno”, il mio gioco![0]
{0753}	GAZ: YES!![1] “Mario” just bought the farm, so[1] um...you can be “Bowser”...[2] I'll be “Geno,” okay?[0]
{0753}I:	TOADO: SÌ!!![1] “Mario” ha tirato le cuoia, quindi[1] ehm... tu puoi fare “Bowser”...[2] Io sarò “Geno,” ok?[0]
{0754}	GAZ: Ready?[1] Let's play from where I left off![5][6]
{0754}I:	TOADO: Pronto?[1] Riprendiamo da dove ero rimasto![5][6]
{0755}	GAZ: Ooh, scary![1] But just watch ME![0]
{0755}I:	TOADO: Che paura![1] Ma guarda ME, invece![0]
{0756}	 Now, Gaz...![1] Mario might be a little tired, dear.[0]
{0756}I:	 Oh, Toado...![1] Caro, forse Mario è un po' stanco.[0]
{0757}	GAZ: Awwww, come on, mom![1] YOU never play with me!...[1] It's no fun playing alone.[0]
{0757}I:	TOADO: Awwww, andiamo, mamma![1] TU non giochi mai con me...![1] E da soli non è divertente.[0]
{0758}	 Oh dear[12]...Mario, I hate to [1] ask, but... Could you play [1] with Gaz for a little while?[0]
{0758}I:	 Oh[12]... Mario, odio dovertelo[1] chiedere, ma... Potresti giocare[1] un po' con Toado?[0]
{0759}	[1] All set?[0]
{0759}I:	[1] Pronto?[0]
{0760}	GAZ: Better watch out, Bowser,[1] cause Geno's gonna blow you away![1] TAKE THIS![0]
{0760}I:	TOADO: Attento, Bowser,[1] Geno ti farà vedere le stelle![1] PRENDI QUESTO![0]
{0761}	GAZ: Your turn, Bowser![0]
{0761}I:	TOADO: A te la mossa![0]
{0762}	GAZ: Owwww...Oh no, if he keeps[1] this up, I'm finished![1] All right, you asked for it![0]
{0762}I:	TOADO: Owww... Oh no, se continua[1] così, sono spacciato![1] E va bene, l'hai voluta tu![0]
{0763}	 The super duper...[2] Custom, patented, one and only...[1] SHOOTING STAR SHOT!![0]
{0763}I:	 Ecco l'unico, il solo...[2] Mega super potente e accessoriato...[1] CANNONE STELLARE!!![0]
{0764}	GAZ: Oops...[12][1] I...[12]uh...[12]I think I...missed.[0]
{0764}I:	TOADO: Oops...[12][1] ...[12] Uh...[12]Credo di... aver mancato.[0]
{0765}	 Oh dear, oh my![1] Mario, are you all right?[0]
{0765}I:	 Oh no, oh, caspita![1] Mario, stai bene?[0]
{0766}	 Hi Mario. Staying for a nap?[2] [7]  (Sure)[1] [7]  (Maybe next time)[0]
{0766}I:	 Ehi, Mario. Dormi da noi?[2] [7]  (Certo)[1] [7]  (Forse un'altra volta)[0]
{0767}	[4] Don't worry. It's on the house.[1] I mean, you were so kind to Gaz.[0]
{0767}I:	[4] Non preoccuparti. Offre la casa.[1] Dal tuo canto, sei stato molto gentile con Toado.[0]
{0768}	[4][1]    Stop by anytime now, you hear?[0]
{0768}I:	[4][1]    Le nostre porte sono sempre aperte, capito?[0]
{0769}	GAZ: Mom! You'll never believe[1] what I just saw...[0]
{0769}I:	TOADO: Mamma! Non crederai mai[1] a ciò che ho visto...[0]
{0770}	GAZ: It was amazing, mom![1] [5]I just saw Geno walk[1] into the forest! Neat, huh?[0]
{0770}I:	TOADO: È stato bellissimo![1] [5]Ho appena visto Geno che[1] entrava nel bosco! Pazzesco, vero?[0]
{0771}	 Yes, dear. That's nice, dear...[1] And isn't Geno the one who broke[1] my lamp the other day?[0]
{0771}I:	 Sì, caro. Bello e tutto...[1] Ma Geno non era quello che l'altro giorno[1] ha rotto la mia lampada?[0]
{0772}	GAZ: Awww, ma, that was just,[1] well, you know...[1] Now THIS WAS REAL![0]
{0772}I:	TOADO: Awww, mamma, era solo perché,[1] be', hai capito...[1] Stavolta È VERO![0]
{0773}	 I SWEAR, Mom, REALLY![1] It's true! I SAW HIM outside![0]
{0773}I:	 Lo GIURO, mamma, CREDIMI![1] È vero! Io L'HO VISTO![0]
{0774}	 All right, Gaz, let's hear it![1] What are you trying to get out of[1] this time, hmmm?[0]
{0774}I:	 E va bene, Toado, sentiamo![1] Cosa hai combinato questa volta, eeeh?[0]
{0775}	GAZ: Mom, I didn't DO anything.[1] I really, TRULY saw Geno walking[1] into the forest![0]
{0775}I:	TOADO: NULLA di nulla, mamma.[1] Ho DAVVERO visto Geno che[1] entrava nel bosco![0]
{0776}	 Mario! How are we feeling?[2] [7]  (Like a new man!)[1] [7]  (Need coffee. Keep away.)[0]
{0776}I:	 Mario! Come ti senti?[2] [7]  (Sono un uomo nuovo!)[1] [7]  (Ho bisogno di caffè. Smamma.)[0]
{0777}	 Well, that's good to hear.[1] Thank you so much for spending[1] time with Gaz.[2] He just loved it![0]
{0777}I:	 Buono a sapersi.[1] Grazie di aver passato così tanto tempo[1] con Toado.[2] Si è divertito molto![0]
{0778}	 Yes, you look awful![1] Why don't you rest some more?[0]
{0778}I:	 Sì, hai una brutta cera![1] Perché non riposi un altro po'?[0]
{0779}	GAZ: S...Sorry if I hurt you![1] But...what would Geno want[1] in the forest?[0]
{0779}I:	TOADO: S-Scusa se ti ho fatto male![1] Ma... cosa ci[1] fa Geno nel bosco?[0]
{0780}	GAZ: Sorry I knocked you down[1] a while ago.[3] Geno...doesn't know his own[1] strength![0]
{0780}I:	TOADO: Scusa se prima ti ho[1] fatto svenire.[3] Geno... non sa controllarsi![0]
{0781}	GAZ: Oh NO![0]
{0781}I:	TOADO: Oh, NO![0]
{0782}	[1]     Oh! This boy is IMPOSSIBLE![0]
{0782}I:	[1]     Oh! Ma sei un bambino IMPOSSIBILE![0]
{0783}	 There's a stairway that leads[1] to my house, but my son's been[1] playing with the controls again![3] Mario, only you could jump up[1] there!  Please...help me get back[1] up to my house![0]
{0783}I:	 C'è una scala per entrare a casa[1] mia, ma mio figlio sta giocando[1] di nuovo con i controlli![3] Mario, sei il solo che riesce a[1] saltare fin là! Ti prego... aiutami[1] a tornare a casa![0]
{0784}	 I wanna go someplace fun![1] Standing around here[1] is soooo bo-oring![0]
{0784}I:	 Voglio andare in un posto[1] divertente! Stare qui[1] è così noioooso![0]
{0785}	[1]                  OUCH![0]
{0785}I:	[1]                  AHIA![0]
{0786}	[1]                 Be quiet![0]
{0786}I:	[1]                 Shh![0]
{0787}	 See, arrows come flying out[1] from the forest...and when you're[1] hit, you can't move! See, look![2] I can't move a muscle. Now I know[1] how a scarecrow feels![0]
{0787}I:	 Vedi... dal bosco vengono[1] scagliate molte frecce... che paralizzano[1] al contatto! Cioè, guarda![2] Non riesco a muovere un muscolo. Ora capisco[1] cosa si prova ad essere uno spaventapasseri![0]
{0788}	 Since the day a shooting star fell[1] into the forest, arrows have been[1] showering our town![0]
{0788}I:	 Da quando quella stella cadente è atterrata[1] nel bosco, la città è[1] bersagliata dalle frecce![0]
{0789}	 I tell you, it's scary out here, but[1] someone's got to pump the water.[0]
{0789}I:	 Qui lo dico e qui lo nego: ho paura di uscire.[1] Ma qualcuno deve pur pompare l'acqua.[0]
{0790}	 My husband still hasn't come back![1] I wonder what's keeping him?[0]
{0790}I:	 Mio marito non è ancora tornata![1] Mi chiedo cosa lo trattenga...[0]
{0791}	 Thanks a million, Mario![1] Say[12][12],...[12][12]were my treasures OK?[2] [7]  (They sure were)[1] [7]  (I wouldn't say so)[0]
{0791}I:	 Grazie mille, Mario![1] Ma dimmi[12][12]...[12][12] che n'è dei miei tesori?[2] [7]  (Tutto ok)[1] [7]  (Sono spariti)[0]
{0792}	 Thanks a million, Mario![1] Say[12][12],...[12][12]were my treasures OK?[2] [7]  (They sure were)[1] [7]  (I wouldn't say so)[0]
{0792}I:	 Grazie mille, Mario![1] Ma dimmi[12][12]...[12][12] che n'è dei miei tesori?[2] [7]  (Tutto ok)[1] [7]  (Sono spariti)[0]

{0793}I:	 Ma dimmi[12][12]...[12][12] che n'è dei miei tesori?[2] [7]  (Tutto ok)[1] [7]  (Sono spariti)[0]
{0794}	 Oh! That's great news![1] What a relief![0]
{0794}I:	 Oh! Buono a sapersi![1] Che sollievo![0]
{0795}	 WHAT?! THEY'RE GONE?![1] MARIO, you're the only one who[1] can reach THEM![2] [7]  (Sorry, I got carried away)[1] [7]  (I don't know anything)[0]
{0795}I:	 COSA?! SONO SPARITI?![1] MARIO, tu eri l'unico a poterli[1] RAGGIUNGERE![2] [7]  (Scusa, mi sono lasciato trasportare)[1] [7]  (Non ne sono niente)[0]
{0796}	[1]             You're kidding!![0]
{0796}I:	[1]             Scherzi?![0]
{0797}	[1]            They're just fine.[0]
{0797}I:	[1]            Sono a posto.[0]
{0798}	[4] Oh, well...[13][64][1] ...since we didn't get hit by any[1] arrows, I'll tell you a secret.[3] Enter the forest. When you hit an[1] area with 4 paths, go left, left,[1] straight, right- in that order.[2] You'll surely find something [5]NICE.[0]
{0798}I:	[4] Oh, be'...[13][64][1] ... dal momento che non siamo stati[1] colpiti dalle frecce, ti dirò un segreto.[3] Se nel bosco t'imbatti[1] in un'area con 4 strade, gira, in quest'ordine, due volte a sinistra,[1] poi dritto e infine a destra.[2] Sono sicuro che troverai qualcosa di [5]BELLO![0]
{0799}	[1] ...since we didn't get hit by any[1] arrows, I'll tell you a secret.[3] Enter the forest. When you hit an[1] area with 4 paths, go left, left,[1] straight, right- in that order.[2] You'll surely find something [5]NICE.[0]

{0800}	 Enter the forest. When you hit an[1] area with 4 paths, go left, left,[1] straight, right- in that order.[2] You'll surely find something [5]NICE.[0]
{0800}I:	 Se nel bosco t'imbatti[1] in un'area con 4 strade, gira, in quest'ordine, due volte a sinistra,[1] poi dritto e infine a destra.[2] Sono sicuro che troverai qualcosa di [5]BELLO![0]
{0801}	[4][1]            Oh, just curious...[0]
{0801}I:	[4][1]         Solo per sapere, eh...[0]
{0802}	[4][1]            Oh, just curious...[0]
{0802}I:	[4][1]         Solo per sapere, eh...[0]
{0803}	[4] There are 2 kinds of mushrooms.[1] One terrorizes people and the other[1] helps people. Avoid the former.[0]
{0803}I:	[4] Ci sono 2 tipi di funghi.[1] Quelli che spaventano le persone e quelli[1] che le aiutano. Evita i primi.[0]
{0804}	[4][1]     All right, I'll take your word.[0]
{0804}I:	[4][1]     Ok, ti credo.[0]
{0805}	 Excuse me, I didn't hear you?[1] [7]  (I'm so sorry)[1] [7]  (I said I don't know)[0]
{0805}I:	 Scusa, puoi ripetere?[1] [7]  (Mi dispiace tanto)[1] [7]  (Ho detto che non lo so)[0]
{0806}	[4] You already found 'em, huh?[1] That's fantastic! Here, why don't[1] you take this along with you?[0]
{0806}I:	[4] Li hai trovati già, eh?[1] Ma è fantastico! Ecco, perché non porti[1] questo con te?[0]
{0807}	 You've found the treasure![1] Way to GO![1] Keep up the good work![0]
{0807}I:	 Hai trovato il tesoro![1] Ben FATTO![1] Continua così![0]
{0808}	 What's taking Daddy so long...?[2] Do you think he's still looking for[1] the treasure?[0]
{0808}I:	 Perché Papino ci sta mettendo così tanto...?[2] Pensi che stia cercando ancora[1] il tesoro?[0]
{0809}	 Button? Yeah, I jumped on it.[1] I do it all the time.[1] It really winds my Dad up![0]
{0809}I:	 Pulsante? Sì, ci sono saltato sopra.[1] Lo faccio sempre.[1] Irrita molto mio Papà![0]
{0810}	 Mario![1] Good to have a customer at last.[1] What do you need?[0]
{0810}I:	 Mario![1] Finalmente un cliente![1] Di cosa hai bisogno?[0]
{0811}	 Hello Mario. It's so nice[1] of you to drop by the shop.[1] What can I do for you?[0]
{0811}I:	 Salve, Mario. Che bello[1] vederti qui.[1] Cosa posso fare per te?[0]
{0812}	 Found me, huh? What are you doing[1] walking around HERE, though?[1] You must be pretty bored...[0]
{0812}I:	 Mi hai trovato, eh? Che ci fai[1] da QUESTE parti?[1] Non hai nulla da fare...?[0]
{0813}	[1]           I... I can't move![0]
{0813}I:	[1]           N-non riesco a muovermi![0]
{0814}	 Oh, this is NOT GOOD...[1] Now I can't go to the forest to[1] chop up any wood.[0]
{0814}I:	 Oh, siamo MESSI MALE...[1] Così non posso andare nella foresta[1] per tagliare la legna.[0]
{0815}	 Just you wait...[0]
{0815}I:	 Aspetta e vedrai...[0]
{0816}	 We're told not to go outside[1] 'cuz it's too dangerous.[0]
{0816}I:	 Ci hanno detto di non uscire[1] perché è troppo pericoloso.[0]
{0817}	 Grandpa's pumping some water for[1] us. I wish we could help, too...[0]
{0817}I:	 Nostro nonno sta pompando l'acqua.[1] Vorrei potessimo aiutare anche noi...[0]
{0818}	 I'm worried about my grandson.[1] He went out to play, but didn't[1] come back when he should have.[0]
{0818}I:	 Sono preoccupato per mio nipote.[1] È uscito a giocare, ma non è[1] ancora tornato.[0]
{0819}	TOAD: Mario! I hate to bother[1] you while you're resting, but I[1] wanted to deliver this to you.[0]
{0819}I:	TOAD: Mario! Scusa il disturbo,[1] ma volevo consegnarti qualcosa.[0]
{0820}	 You know what's really weird?[1] I just saw a doll dressed in a blue[1] cape walking towards the forest.[0]
{0820}I:	 Sai cos'è strano?[1] Ho appena visto una marionetta con un[1] mantello blu che entrava nel bosco.[0]
{0821}	 A...walking doll? Yeah, sure pal![1] I think you need some help.[1] Now SCRAM![0]
{0821}I:	 Una... marionetta che cammina? Come no![1] Vatti a fare una visita.[1] E ora SMAMMA![0]
{0822}	[1] Okay, hit as many as you can![1] Ready?[13][48]...GO![13][48][6]
{0822}I:	[1] Ok, colpiscine il più possibile![1] Pronto?[13][48]... VIA![13][48][6]
{0823}	GAZ: Geno! You came back![0]
{0823}I:	TOADO: Geno! Sei tornato![0]
{0824}	GAZ: SEE, Mom? THIS is the Geno[1] I was talking about![0]
{0824}I:	TOADO: VEDI, Mamma? ECCO quel Geno[1] di cui ti parlavo![0]
{0825}	 My, my, what a fabulous costume![1] It must be kind of hot for the[1] person wearing it, though.[0]
{0825}I:	 Ih, ih, ma che bel costume![1] Indossarlo, però dev'essere difficile.[1] Chissà che caldo![0]
{0826}	GAZ: Awww, forget it, mom.[0]
{0826}I:	TOADO: Awww, mamma, smettila.[0]
{0827}	[1] All right, Geno, let's play![0]
{0827}I:	[1] Ok, Geno. Giochiamo![0]
{0828}	GENO: How I wish I could![1] But Mario and I must leave now[1] to find...[2] ...the missing Star Pieces...[0]
{0828}I:	GENO: Vorrei poterlo fare![1] Ma Mario e io dobbiamo partire[1] alla ricerca...[2] ... delle Scheggestella perdute...[0]
{0829}	GAZ: Star Pieces? You mean like[1] shooting stars? What for?[0]
{0829}I:	TOADO: Perché? Scheggestella? Sono tipo[1] stelle cadenti?[0]
{0830}	GENO: Well...[1] How can I explain this[12]...[12][0]
{0830}I:	GENO: Be'...[1] Come posso spiegarlo[12]...[12][0]
{0831}	GENO: Well Gaz,...[1] it's like this...[13][32][6]
{0831}I:	GENO: Ok, Toado...[1] le cose stanno così...[13][32][6]
{0832}	 Well, good luck![0]
{0832}I:	 Buona fortuna, allora![0]
{0833}	[4]Time    [28][0][1]Points [28][1][6]
{0833}I:	[4]Tempo:    [28][0][1]Punti: [28][1][6]

{0835}I:	[4]Tempo:    [28][0][1]Punti: [28][1][6]
{0836}	 It's easier if ya stand[1] in the middle.[6]
{0836}I:	 È più facile se stai al[1] centro[6]
{0837}	 That was SOME thumping![1] Here's your prize! Next time,[1] try and get [28][0] pts.[0]
{0837}I:	 C'era POCO pathos![1] Ecco il tuo premio! La prossima volta,[1] prova ad ottenere [28][0] pt.
{0838}	[1]     You can do better than that![0]
{0838}I:	[1]     Puoi fare meglio di così![0]
{0839}	[4][1]              Then SCRAM![0]
{0839}I:	[4][1]     Allora vedi di SMAMMARE![0]
{0840}	 Looks like you've got[1] yourself a tough road ahead.[1] Good luck![0]
{0840}I:	 Grandi avversità vi[1] attendono al varco.[1] Buona fortuna![0]
{0841}	 [1] This is how it used to be,[2] but now...it's like...[13][32][6]
{0841}I:	 [1] Ecco com'era prima,[2] ma adesso... è diventata...[13][32][6]
{0842}	 THIS![1] Do you get it?[0]
{0842}I:	 COSÌ![1] Hai capito?[0]
{0843}	GAZ: Uh uh... NOPE![2] You lost me.[0]
{0843}I:	TOADO: Uh uh... NO![2] Mi sono perso.[0]
{0844}	GENO: Well, let's just say that if[1] things stay the way they are, your[1] wishes will never come true.[0]
{0844}I:	GENO: Ok, diciamo che solo che[1] se le cose continuano così, i tuoi[1] desideri non si realizzeranno mai.[0]
{0845}	GAZ: WHAT?! So you mean even if[1] I grow up, I won't ever be strong[1] and cool like you?![0]
{0845}I:	TOADO: COSA?! Quindi vuoi[1] dire che nemmeno da grande potrò[1] essere forte e tosto come te?![0]
{0846}	GENO: No one's wishes will come[1] true until the Star Pieces are[1] found and the Star Road repaired.[0]
{0846}I:	GENO: Nessun desiderio si realizzerà[1] finché le Scheggestella non[1] verranno ritrovate e la Stada Stellare riparata.[0]
{0847}	[4] Which is why I have chosen to[1] join these two in order to find[1] the missing Star Pieces.[0]
{0847}I:	[4] Ed è questo il motivo per cui[1] ho deciso di unirmi a questi due[1] e ritrovare le Scheggestella perdute.[0]
{0848}	GAZ: So that's it...[12]...[12]![1] Well, Mario needs all the help[1] he can get![0]
{0848}I:	TOADO: Le cose stanno così, allora...[12]...[12]![1] Beh, Mario ha bisogno di tutto l'aiuto[1] possibile![0]
{0849}	[4] Geno, I have a lot of dreams![1] Please, go fix the Star Road and[1] make sure they all come true![0]
{0849}I:	[4] Geno, io ho molti sogni![1] Ti prego, ripara la Strada Stellare e[1] fa' che si realizzino![0]
{0850}	GENO: That's a promise![0]
{0850}I:	GENO: Lo prometto![0]
{0851}	GAZ: COOL!![0]
{0851}I:	TOADO: FORTE!!![0]
{0852}	GAZ: Oh, wait!  Wait a minute![0]
{0852}I:	TOADO: Oh, aspetta!  Un attimo![0]
{0853}	GAZ: This is yours, Geno, so take[1] it along with you.[0]
{0853}I:	TOADO: Geno, porta questo con te.[1] Ti appartiene.[0]
{0854}	GAZ: Go get 'em, Geno![1] You're the main man![0]
{0854}I:	TOADO: Forza![1] Fai vedere a tutti chi sei![0]
{0855}	GAZ: It's gonna be a little lonely[1] without you, but...hey, I can[1] handle it.[0]
{0855}I:	TOADO: Sentirò la tua mancanza, ma...[1] ehi, posso farcela.[0]
{0856}	GENO: Thanks for being a good[1] sport, Gaz. I'll see you when I[1] get back.[0]
{0856}I:	GENO: Sei stato un buon compagno,[1] grazie, Toado. Ci rivedremo[1] al mio ritorno.[0]
{0857}	[1] Mommy![0]
{0857}I:	[1] Mamma![0]
{0858}	 I can finally move![2] I guess I owe it all to Mario...[1] What an amazing guy![0]
{0858}I:	 Finalmente! Riesco a muovermi![2] Beh, devo tutto a te, Mario...[1] Sei fantastico![0]
{0859}	[1]            I'm finally HOME![0]
{0859}I:	[1]            Finalmente a CASA![0]
{0860}	 Can't believe we had arrows[1] showering down around here...[0]
{0860}I:	 Ancora non mi capacito che delle[1] frecce cadessero qui...[0]
{0861}	 Good, now I can finally go to the[1] forest to chop some wood.[0]
{0861}I:	 Bene, ora posso finalmente tornare[1] nel bosco a tagliare la legna.[0]
{0862}	 I'm so proud of my Grandson.[1] Just look at him.[0]
{0862}I:	 Sono così fiero di mio nipote.[1] Cioè, guardalo![0]
{0863}	 My Grandson has come back home[1] in one piece. Thank you, Mario![0]
{0863}I:	 Mio nipote è tornato a casa[1] tutto intero. Grazie, Mario![0]
{0864}	 There's nothing to worry about[1] anymore! I can finally relax.[0]
{0864}I:	 Non c'è più nulla di cui preoccuparsi![1] Finalmente posso riposare.[0]
{0865}	 Phew..[12]..[12] That was close,[1] but I made it on time...[12]..[12][0]
{0865}I:	 Fiu...[12]...[12] C'è mancato poco,[1] ma ce l'ho fatta...[12]...[12][0]
{0866}	[4][1]                 [28][1] points[6]
{0866}I:	[4][1]                 [28][1] punti[6]
{0867}	[1]          Hey, I'll carry that![0]
{0867}I:	[1]          Ehi, quello lo porto io![0]
{0868}	 Hi, Mario! Bet you're gonna be[1] pretty busy from here on.[1] What can I get you?[0]
{0868}I:	 Ciao, Mario! Scommetto che da[1] ora in avrai un bel da fare.[1] Cosa posso fare per te?[0]
{0869}	 I thought I heard a big boom over[1] from the mountains. Hmmmm, guess[1] I'm starting to hear things...[0]
{0869}I:	 Mi è parso di sentire un grande[1] botto venire dalle montagne. Uh...[1] forse viaggio troppo di fantasia...[0]
{0870}	 Things are finally back to[1] normal. Thank you, Mario.[0]
{0870}I:	 Le cose si sono sistemate,[1] finalmente. Grazie, Mario.[0]
{0871}	 Thanks, Mario! Now we can all go[1] outside and do what we want[1] without worrying.[0]
{0871}I:	 Grazie, Mario! Ora possiamo uscire[1] e fare quel che vogliamo[1] senza preoccupazioni.[0]
{0872}	 Be careful, hon.[0]
{0872}I:	 Caro, fa' attenzione.[0]
{0873}	 Come back again, you hear?[1] Have you been to Yo'ster Isle?[2] [7]  (You betcha)[1] [7]  (Nope, not yet)[0]
{0873}I:	 Ehi, torna presto![1] Sei mai stato all'Isola Yoshi?[2] [7]  (Puoi scommetterci)[1] [7]  (No, non ancora)[0]
{0874}	[4] Oh, I see...[2] So you've tried your luck with the[1] Goomba thumping game, huh?[0]
{0874}I:	[4] Oh, capisco...[2] Quindi hai tentato la sorte col[1] gioco dell'Acchiappa Goomba, eh?[0]
{0875}	[4] You have to go through the[1] pipes to get there![0]
{0875}I:	[4] Se vuoi raggiungerla[1] dovrai entrare nei tubi![0]
{0876}	 Now I can finally move. Maybe I'll[1] go pick mushrooms in the forest.[2] It's a little scary, but I'll take my[1] chances.[0]
{0876}I:	 Finalmente posso muovermi. Credo che[1] andrò a funghi nel bosco.[2] Ho un po' di paura, ma correrò il rischio.[0]
{0877}	 Wait[12][12]...[1] Why did I even come to Mushroom[1] Kingdom in the first place?[5][6]
{0877}I:	 Ma[12][12]...[1] Com'è ch'ero venuto nel Regno[1] dei Funghi?[5][6]
{0878}	[1] Guess I'll find out soon enough.[0]
{0878}I:	[1] Ah be', suppongo lo scoprirò presto.[0]
{0879}	[4] Hey, if you're out of cash,[1] better learn to stash.[0]
{0879}I:	[4] Ehi, se di soldi non ne hai,[1] risparmia e non te ne pentirai.[0]
{0880}	CHANCELLOR: Oh, Mario!...[1] There's something important[1] I need to discuss with you.[0]
{0880}I:	MINISTRO: Oh, Mario...[1]  C'è qualcosa d'importante di[1] cui dobbiamo discutere.[0]
{0881}	 That Hammer you got...you've[1] equipped it, right?[0]
{0881}I:	 Quel Martello che hai... è[1] equipaggiato, vero?[0]
{0882}	[1]   You're all set for your journey?[0]
{0882}I:	[1]   Siete pronti a partire?[0]
{0883}	[4] Shall I have Toad explain the[1] process?[2] [7]  (Yes, please)[1] [7]  (Absolutely no need at all)[0]
{0883}I:	[4] Per caso devo dire a Toad di[1] spiegarti come fare?[2] [7]  (Sì, per favore)[1] [7]  (Assolutamente NO)[0]
{0884}	[4]TOAD: You will “equip” things[1] using the menu.[2] Please press the “X” Button.[6]
{0884}I:	[4]TOAD: Puoi “equipaggiare”[1] attraverso il menù.[2] Aprilo premendo “X”.[6]
{0885}	CHANCELLOR: There, now I feel[1] more at ease.[1] Now it's all up to you.[0]
{0885}I:	MINISTRO: Ora sì che mi sento[1] a mio agio.[1] Adesso è tutto nelle tue mani.[0]
{0886}	  [4]CHANCELLOR: I see. Well then,[2] NEVER forget to equip new[1] weapons and armor![1] Farewell and good luck![0]
{0886}I:	  [4]MINISTRO: Capisco. E va bene,[2] NON scordare MAI di equipaggiare[1] nuove armi e armature![1] Addio... e buona fortuna![0]
{0887}	 Oh, and take this along with you.[2] It should help you out.[0]
{0887}I:	 Ah, e porta questo con te.[1] Ti servirà.[0]
{0888}	[1] You take care, Grandma,[1] you hear?[0]
{0888}I:	[1] Prenditi cura di te, Nonna,[1] ok?[0]
{0889}	 Hey![12][12]...[12][12]You gave it to someone![2] You're gonna get it![0]
{0889}I:	 Ehi[12][12]...![12][12] L'hai dato a qualcuno![2] Ora le prendi![0]
{0890}	 You're gonna get it![0]
{0890}I:	 Ora le prendi![0]
{0891}	 (Congratulations![1]  Yoshi came in first![1]  A prize goes to the winner!)[0]
{0891}I:	 (Congratulazioni![1]  Yoshi è arrivato primo![1]  Il vincitore merita un premio!)[0]
{0892}	 (Congratulations![1]  Yoshi came in first![1]  A prize goes to the winner!)[0]
{0892}I:	 (Congratulazioni![1]  Yoshi è arrivato primo![1]  Il vincitore merita un premio!)[0]
{0893}	 (Oh, you were SO close![1]  Too bad Yoshi lost...[1]  Let's race again, sometime.)[0]
{0893}I:	 (Per un PELO![1] Peccato che Yoshi abbia perso...[1]  Corriamo ancora prima o poi.)
{0894}	 (Sorry.[1]  Yoshi lost...[1]  Better luck next time.)[0]
{0894}I:	 (Scusa.[1]  Yoshi ha perso...[1]  Andrà meglio la prossima volta.)[1]
{0895}	[1]                  GOAL![13][48][6]
{0895}I:	[1]                  FINE![13][48][6]
{0896}	YOSHI: (Saddle up?)[1] [7]  (Sure!)[1] [7]  (No thanks)[0]
{0896}I:	YOSHI: (Vuoi salire?)[1] [7]  (Certo!)[1] [7]  (No, grazie)[0]
{0897}	YOSHI: (Saddle up?)[1] [7]  (Sure!)[1] [7]  (No thanks)[0]
{0897}I:	YOSHI: (Vuoi salire?)[1] [7]  (Certo!)[1] [7]  (No, grazie)[0]
{0898}	[4][1]         (Okay then, hop on!)[0]
{0898}I:	[4][1]         (Ok, salta su!)[0]
{0899}	[4][1]         (All right, see ya...)[0]
{0899}I:	[4][1]         (Va bene, ci vediamo...)[0]
{0900}	YOSHI: (Come on, hop aboard!)[0]
{0900}I:	YOSHI: (Forza, salta su!)[0]
{0901}	 (Boshi here is the fastest runner[1]  ...but he's full of himself!)[0]
{0901}I:	 (Washi è il corridore più veloce[1]  ... ma è anche pieno di sé!)[0]
{0902}	 (Boshi only races one-on-one[1]  so everyone can't join us.[1]  Bummer!)[0]
{0902}I:	 (Accetta solo sfide uno contro uno[1]  per non far partecipare gli altri.[1]  Che guastafeste!)[0]
{0903}	 (What? Are you cracked?[1]  Racing's my life![1]  I could run all day!)[0]
{0903}I:	 (Cosa? Sei pazzo?[1]  Sono nato per correre![1]  Potrei farlo tutto il giorno!)[0] 
{0904}	[1] (Careful, don't step on the eggs.)[0]
{0904}I:	[1] (Attento a non calpestare le uova.)[0]
{0905}	 (Hey, Yoshi! [5]Think you can[1]  beat the old Boshi today?)[2]  [7] (Of course)[1]  [7] (No, not today)[0]
{0905}I:	 (Ehi, Yoshi! [5]Pensi di poter[1]  battere il buon vecchio Washi?)[2]  [7] (Certo)[1]  [7] (Non ora)[0]
{0906}	BOSHI: (What're YOU lookin' at?[2] If you wanna challenge me,[1] you have to bring Cookies!)[0]
{0906}I:	WASHI: (Cosa TI guardi?[2] Se vuoi sfidarmi,[1] devi portarmi dei Biscotti!)[0]
{0907}	BOSHI: (SO! You brought the[1] Cookies. All right![2] Consider yourself lucky today.[2] You've got yourself a race...[1] One-on-one!)[0]
{0907}I:	WASHI: (ECCO! Hai portato i[1] Biscotti. Perfetto![2] Considerati fortunato.[2] Ti sei guadagnato una corsa...[1] Uno contro uno!)[0]
{0908}	BOSHI:[1] (This is as easy as it gets, man.)[0]
{0908}I:	WASHI:[1] (Ok, bello.)[0]
{0909}	[1]      (That can't happen twice!)[0]
{0909}I:	[1]      (Non può succedere di nuovo!)[0]
{0910}	BOSHI: (Come back when you're[1] SERIOUS! Now, I think those[1] Cookies there belong to ME!)[0]
{0910}I:	WASHI: (Tornate solo se dovete essere[1] SERI! E ora, credo proprio che quei[1] Biscotti MI appartengano!)[0]
{0911}	BOSHI: (Come back when you're[1] SERIOUS! Now, I think those[1] Cookies there belong to ME!)[0]
{0911}I:	WASHI: (Tornate solo se dovete essere[1] SERI! E ora, credo proprio che quei[1] Biscotti MI appartengano!)[0]
{0912}	 (Wow! Unbelievable![2]  You just beat BOSHI!)[0]
{0912}I:	 (Uao! Incredibile![2]  Avete battuto WASHI!)[0]
{0913}	 (Starting today, Yoshi's[1]  the new BOSS around HERE!)[0]
{0913}I:	 (E da oggi, il nuovo CAPO[1]  da queste parti sarà Yoshi!)[0]
{0914}	YOSHI: (But we don't need a BOSS![1] Anyway, I just want to race!)[0]
{0914}I:	YOSHI: (Non abbiamo bisogno di un CAPO![1] E in ogni caso io voglio solo gareggiare!)[0]
{0915}	YOSHI: (Come on, Boshi![1] Let's see what you're made of!)[0]
{0915}I:	YOSHI: (Andiamo, Washi![1] Vediamo di cosa sei fatto!)[0]
{0916}	BOSHI: (Hmmm...[13][48]All right![1] Just stay outta my way![2] Oh, here's the Cookie stash[1] for the winner.)[0]
{0916}I:	WASHI: (Hmmm...[13][48] Va bene![1] Basta che non m'intralci![2] Oh, ecco il rifornimento di Biscotti[1] per il vincitore.)[0]
{0917}	YOSHI: (Thanks to you, Mario,[12][12][1]  I finally beat that rascal! And[1] we can all race together now!)[0]
{0917}I:	YOSHI: (Grazie a te, Mario,[12][12][1]  ho battuto quel mascalzone! Ora[1] possiamo gareggiare tutti assieme!)[0]
{0918}	YOSHI: (Here's something to[1] remember me by!)[0]
{0918}I:	YOSHI: (Ecco un piccolo[1] souvenir!)[0]
{0919}	 (Next time you're in trouble[1]  during battle, use this to[1]  give me a call.)[0]
{0919}I:	 (La prossima volta che in battaglia[1]  sei alle strette, chiamami[1]  con questo.)[0]
{0920}	            Found a Cookie![6]
{0920}I:	         Trovato: Biscotto![6]
{0921}	 (It would be so much better if we[1]  could all race together!)[0]
{0921}I:	 (Sarebbe meglio poter[1]  gareggiare tutti assieme!)[0]
{0922}	TOAD: Hello again! Get ready, the[1] “Mushroom Derby” is coming up.[2] Want instructions?[2] [7]  (Sure!)[1] [7]  (No thanks)[0]
{0922}I:	TOAD: Ehilà! Preparatevi: la[1] “Coppa Fungo” sta per iniziare.[2] Volete sapere come si gioca?[2] [7]  (Certo!)[1] [7]  (No, grazie)[0]
{0923}	[4][1]           (See you around!)[0]
{0923}I:	[4][1]           (Ci si vede!)[0]
{0924}	[4] Keep alternating between the A[1] Button and the B Button in time[1] with the beat! Let's practice![0]
{0924}I:	[4] Continua ad alternare i pulsanti[1] A e B seguendo il ritmo della[1] musica! Facciamo pratica![0]
{0925}	One [6]
{0925}I:	Uno [6]
{0926}	Two [6]
{0926}I:	Due [6]
{0927}	Three [6]
{0927}I:	Tre [6]
{0928}	                 Got it![6]
{0928}I:	              Ho capito![6]
{0929}	Two [0]
{0929}I:	Due [0]
{0930}	[4] You're not getting it right at all.[1] Are you sure you want to do this?[2] [7]  (I'll practice again)[1] [7]  (Race Time!)[0]
{0930}I:	[4] Non ci sei proprio![1] Sicuro di voler partire?[2] [7]  (Farò altra pratica)[1] [7]  (Via alla corsa!)[0]
{0931}	[4] You still have some problems.[1] Come on! CONCENTRATE![2] [7]  (I'll practice some more)[1] [7]  (RACE TIME!)[0]
{0931}I:	[4] Ancora non va.[1] Andiamo! CONCENTRATI![2] [7]  (Farò ancora altra pratica)[1] [7]  (VIA ALLA CORSA!)[0]
{0932}	[4][1]     There you go, that's the way![0]
{0932}I:	[4][1]     Evvai, così si fa![0]
{0933}	[4][1]    Now, shall we go to the race?[0]
{0933}I:	[4][1]    Ebbene, partecipiamo alla corsa?[0]
{0934}	YOSHI: (Looks like I need a little[1] more practice. Oh, well...[1] let's try it again sometime.)[0]
{0934}I:	YOSHI: (Forse dovrei[1] fare più pratica. Oh, be'...[1] ci riproveremo.)[0]
{0935}	YOSHI: (Looks like I need a little[1] more practice. Oh, well...[1] let's try it again sometime.)[0]
{0935}I:	YOSHI: (Forse dovrei[1] fare più pratica. Oh, be'...[1] ci riproveremo.)[0]
{0936}	YOSHI: (Looks like I need a little[1] more practice. Oh, well...[1] let's try it again sometime.)[0]

{0937}I:	YOSHI: (Forse dovrei[1] fare più pratica. Oh, be'...[1] ci riproveremo.)[0]
{0938}	[4] (Here, take my Cookies.[1]  Good luck! I'm rooting for you!)[0]
{0938}I:	[4] (Ecco, prendi i miei Biscotti.[1]  Buona fortuna! Faccio il tifo per te!)[0]
{0939}	[4] (Yeah, maybe another day...[2]  So you've heard, right?...[2]  I'm just waiting for the day we[1]  can all race together.)[0]
{0939}I:	[4] (Certo, prima o poi...[2]  E così, mi hai sentito, eh...?[2]  Aspetto il giorno in cui potremo[1]  gareggiare insieme.)[0]
{0940}	 (It's the best when we can[1]  all race together!)[0]
{0940}I:	 (C'è più gusto a gareggiare[1]  tutti insieme!)[0]
{0941}	[4] (Wait a sec...[1]  You don't have any Cookies...[3]  Well, since Yoshi got everyone to[1]  race again, I'll give you mine as[1]  a reward. Here, take 'em!)[0]
{0941}I:	[4] (Ehi, un attimo...[1]  Non hai alcun Biscotto...[3]  Be', visto che Yoshi ha permesso[1]  a tutti di correre di nuovo, come ricompensa[1]  ti darò i miei. Ecco, prendi!)[0]
{0942}	[4] (Remember, you need Cookies[1] if you want to race!)[0]
{0942}I:	[4] (Ricorda: se vuoi gareggiare devi[1] portare dei Biscotti!)[0]
{0943}	            Got [28][0] Cookie(s)![0]
{0943}I:	            Biscotti ottenuti: [28][0]![0]
{0944}	[4]YOSHI:[1]          I'll try my very best![0]
{0944}I:	[4]YOSHI:[1]          Ce la metterò tutta![0]
{0945}	[4] (Now no one has to be[1]  left out of a race!)[0]
{0945}I:	[4] (Nessuno dev'essere[1]  escluso dalla corsa!)[0]
{0946}	[4]BOSHI: (Let's race again[1] sometime, all right?)[0]
{0946}I:	[4]WASHI: (Ti andrebbe di correre[1] di nuovo, prima o poi, vero?)[0]
{0947}	[4][1]       One[6]
{0947}I:	[4][1]       Uno[6]

{0949}	[4] (Okay, now. Line up beside me[1]   and we'll get this race going!)[0]
{0949}I:	[4] (Ok. Mettiti di fianco a me[1]   e diamo inizio alla corsa!)[0]
{0950}	 (You're carrying a lot of things![1]  I'll store these [28][0] for you.[1]  Don't worry...I won't eat them.[2]  That makes a total of [28][1]. )[0]
{0950}I:	 (Stai portando troppi oggetti![1]  Questi [28][0] li terrò io.[1]  Non preoccuparti... non li mangerò.[2]  E con questi siamo a [28][1]. )[0]
{0951}	 (That was mighty tasty.[1]  So now we're back to 200![2]  Thanks for the snack!)[0]
{0951}I:	 (Che sapore prorompente![1]  E così siamo di nuovo 200![2]  Grazie per lo spuntino!)[0]
{0952}	 (That was mighty tasty.[1]  So now we're back to 200![2]  Thanks for the snack!)[0]
{0952}I:	 (Che sapore prorompente![1]  E così siamo di nuovo 200![2]  Grazie per lo spuntino!)[0]
{0953}	 (You're carrying too many things[1]  and storing too many at the same[1]  time. It'd be a shame to waste[2]  them, so I'll grab a few to eat.)[0]
{0953}I:	 (Hai troppi oggetti con te.[1]  E anche le riserve sono piene.[1]  Sarebbe un peccato sprecarli,[2]  quindi me ne mangerò qualcuno.)[0]
{0954}	[5][6]
{0954}I:	[5][6]
{0955}	YOSHI: (Thanks! I've got[1] MAJOR support on my side, so[1] I can probably win today!)[0]
{0955}I:	YOSHI: (Grazie! Ho un[1] ASSO nella manica e con tutte probabilità potrei[1] vincere!)[0]
{0956}	[1]        Yoshi got some Cookies![0]
{0956}I:	[1]Yoshi ha ottenuto dei Biscotti![0]
{0957}	              Got a “Map”![0]
{0957}I:	              Ottenuta: “Mappa”![0]
{0958}	              Got a “Map”![0]
{0958}I:	              Ottenuta: “Mappa”![0]
{0959}	 I almost forgot![3] This may not help you, but...[2] Why don't you take it along![0]
{0959}I:	 Quasi dimenticavo![3] Potrebbe non servirti, ma...[2] Perché non lo porti con te?[0]
{0960}	MALLOW:[1]   What on earth ...WAS THAT?![0]
{0960}I:	MALLOW:[1]   Ma che cavolo... È STATO?![0]
{0961}	GENO: Well, we won the battle.[1] Now I hope we don't lose the war.[1] Where are Dyna and the star?[0]
{0961}I:	GENO: Abbiamo vinto la battaglia.[1] E spero che non perderemo la guerra.[1] A proposito: dove sono Dina e la stella?[0]
{0962}	GENO: I guess my question's just[1] been answered...[0]
{0962}I:	GENO: Lupus in fabula![0]
{0963}	MALLOW: Come on Mario, let's GO![0]
{0963}I:	MALLOW: Forza, Mario, ANDIAMO![0]
{0964}	 Forgive me.[2] But I can't stop worrying[1] about the Princess...[0]
{0964}I:	 Chiedo venia.[2] Ma non riesco a smettere[1] di preoccuparmi per la Principesa...[0]

{1274}	 Ok, listen up.[1] Look for the whirl where the ant[1] pops up and proceed after it.[3] Keep following it and you'll find[1] your way underground.[3] Once there, Monstro Town's just[1] around the corner.[1] I'll see you there.[0]
{1274}I:
{1275}	 What did you do that for?[3] You won't get any coins from[1] jumping on me. It's Wiggler or[1] Shogun you ought to look for.[0]
{1275}I:

{1303}	 You can cross the “Sky Bridge” in[1] one of 3 ways. However, if you[1] fall at any time, you'll lose.[3] On the Normal course, you'll make[1] it across just by jumping.[2] You'll get 5 coins for that.[3] On the Special course, the blocks[1] will fall if your time runs out.[2] You'll get 8 coins there.[3] On the Expert course, the blocks[1] will fall AND the jumps are harder.[2] You'll get a Frog Coin there.[3] On all the courses, you'll have to[1] jump and avoid the bullet guys.[3][6]
{1303}I:
{1304}	 Which course do you want?[2]  [7] (Normal)[1]  [7] (Special)[1]  [7] (Expert)[0]
{1304}I:

{2198}I:
{2199}	 I wish those two a wonderful[1] life together.[2] Hope they don't fight too often![0]
{2199}I:
{2200}	 Oh man, is it over, yet?[2] I hate getting my picture taken.[0]
{2200}I:
{2201}	SNIFIT 1: Ready?[1] Here we go!...[5][0]
{2201}I:
{2202}	 All right,[2] on the count of 3, say[1] “Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”[0]
{2202}I:
{2203}	BOWSER: (Can't...[12][12]tell 'em...[1] the truth...If this gets out...[2] I'm finished...!)[0]
{2203}I:
{2204}	CHANCELLOR: Y,[12] yes...[12][12]I see.[0]
{2204}I:
{2205}	MALLOW: Wrong way, Mario![1] She went through THAT door![0]
{2205}I:
{2206}	TOADSTOOL: Bowser...[1] Perhaps it's time you[1] told us your story![3] What, exactly, did you mean[1] when you said you had,[1] “Bigger fish to fry?”[0]
{2206}I:
{2207}	MALLOW: Excuse me, Sir...[1] Perhaps I can set the stage, and[2] the others can add their comments[1] along the way![0]
{2207}I:
{2208}	 The Princess, Bowser and Mario[2] were thrown in different directions[1] after a terrible explosion...[0]
{2208}I:
{2209}	[4] Something HUGE crashed through[1] the Star Road high above[1] Bowser's place...[12]and[12]...[0]
{2209}I:
{2210}	[4] And went....[0]
{2210}I:
{2211}	[4][1]                KABOOM![3]  [1]     Right into Bowser's Keep!![0]
{2211}I:
{2212}	 It was a gigantic sword![3] Now Bowser's Keep has been[1] taken over by monsters who work[1] for some creep named “Smithy.”[0]
{2212}I:
{2213}	BOWSER: They've thrown me out[1] of my own...[13][48] I mean...[2] I decided to take a vacation![5][6]
{2213}I:
{2214}	[1] ...Mario walked up to me and[1] BEGGED me to let him join the[1] Koopa Troop! I had no choice[2] but to let him in. It was pathetic.[0]
{2214}I:
{2215}	MALLOW: Hello~, is anybody home?[1] I just said she went through[1] THAT door, over there![0]
{2215}I:
{2216}	TOADSTOOL: Chancellor![5][6]
{2216}I:
{2217}	[1] Listen, everyone, RELAX![1] Mario's got things under control![0]
{2217}I:
{2218}	[1] Anyway, I was working on a plan[1] to get my house back, when...[0]
{2218}I:
{2219}	      [1] They CAN'T do this to me![5][6]
{2219}I:
{2220}	TOADSTOOL: It's okay, Mario.[1] We know Bowser's stretching[1] the truth a little![0]
{2220}I:
{2221}	[4] And...um, Geno,... was it?[1] Why are you and Mario...[0]
{2221}I:
{2222}	[4] And...Mallow...how about you?[1] Why are you traveling with Mario?[0]
{2222}I:
{2223}	MALLOW: Well, because Mario's[1] helping me find my real home...[1] And my parents...[3] That's why we're[1] on the road together.[0]
{2223}I:
{2224}	 Welcome back, Mario![1] All's well here![0]
{2224}I:
{2225}	 Mario, where have you been?[1] I've never been so worried! I'm[1] so angry I can't see straight![2] Would you want to marry someone[1] who can't see straight?![0]
{2225}I:
{2226}	 Lately, the Princess hasn't been[1] around to look at the flowers.[0]
{2226}I:
{2227}	 Wow! That sure woke me up![0]
{2227}I:
{2228}	TOADSTOOL: Shhhh....[2] If people see who I'm with, they'll[1] flip out, so...[2] Let's be real quiet![0]
{2228}I:
{2229}	 I just love the smell of flowers![3][12][12] I'm sorry...I'm in a rush right[1] now. I'll come back another time.[0]
{2229}I:
{2230}	 Mario, welcome home![1] Please, go in.[0]
{2230}I:
{2231}	 Oooh! It's good to see you back.[1] Look what I found in the wallet[1] you returned to me.[3] It's yours, isn't it?[0]
{2231}I:
{2232}	 Were you able to rescue the[1] Princess from Bowser,[2] that good for noth...[0]
{2232}I:
{2233}	[4] Eh?[1] W...what was that...odd noise?[0]
{2233}I:
{2234}	 Say hey! Welcome back.[1] The Chancellor's been worrying[2] about you ever since you left.[1] Come see me later![0]
{2234}I:
{2235}	 Avoid fighting the pointy monsters[1] up on Star Hill.[0]
{2235}I:
{2236}	 Hey Mario! Wanna grab something[1] to eat?[0]
{2236}I:
{2237}	[1]    Go on now, don't hang back![0]
{2237}I:
{2238}	 Mario, go see my brother[1] jump. He's been practicing[1] like crazy![0]
{2238}I:
{2239}	 Boing, boing, boing...[2] Hey, Mario![1] I can out jump YOU now![2] [7]  (Impressive!)[1] [7]  (Keep practicing, kid)[0]
{2239}I:
{2240}	[4][1]               ALL RIGHT![0]
{2240}I:
{2241}	 Hello Mario! Oh, hi, Mallow,[1] didn't see you there![1] Well, what can I get you two?[0]
{2241}I:
{2242}	 Enough with the chatter...[2] On your way, now.[0]
{2242}I:
{2243}	            Got a Frog Coin![0]
{2243}I:
{2244}	TOAD: Mario!...[1] Welcome back!![1] You look like you're in one piece![0]
{2244}I:
{2245}	[1]           P..[12][12].P..[12]Princess![0]
{2245}I:
{2246}	TOADSTOOL: I'm finally home![2] And with Mario...[0]
{2246}I:
{2247}	[1] and some wonderful...[1] new friends! They saved my life.[0]
{2247}I:
{2248}	TOAD:[1]    Let's go find the Chancellor...[0]
{2248}I:
{2249}	TOADSTOOL:[1]                 Lead on![0]
{2249}I:
{2250}	[4] Come on Mario. We mustn't[1] keep the Chancellor waiting![0]
{2250}I:
{2251}	 Mario! Welcome home.[2] The place is looking sharp,[1] is it not?[0]
{2251}I:
{2252}	TOAD: Chancellor![2] The...the Princess...[1] She's BACK!![0]
{2252}I:
{2253}	CHANCELLOR: Thank goodness![2] This has been a true nightmare![5][6]
{2253}I:
{2254}	 I'm a nervous wreck![0]
{2254}I:
{2255}	TOADSTOOL: I know I've worried[1] everyone...[5][6]
{2255}I:
{2256}	[4] But I'm fine![1] I can take care of myself...[2] ...With a little help from Mario![0]
{2256}I:
{2257}	CHANCELLOR: Come, everyone![2] Let's get out of this[1] drafty doorway![0]
{2257}I:
{2258}	TOADSTOOL: Mario, I hope you[1] know how thankful we are![0]
{2258}I:
{2259}	 But...[12][12]you MUST tell[1] me one thing! How on earth[2] can you trust...[12][12]Bowser?[0]
{2259}I:
{2260}	CHANCELLOR: Trust...Bowser?[1] What ARE you talking about?![0]
{2260}I:
{2261}	CHANCELLOR: Mario![1] What are YOU doing with...[0]
{2261}I:
{2262}	[1]       WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?[0]
{2262}I:
{2263}	[1]                 EGADS![0]
{2263}I:
{2264}	GENO: The Star Road has been[1] destroyed. I'm here to fix it.[3] Mario is helping me search for[1] the Star Pieces. I need them to[1] rebuild the road...[0]
{2264}I:
{2265}	TOADSTOOL: Star...Pieces?[0]
{2265}I:
{2266}	MALLOW: The Star Road grants[1] our wishes![3] Unless we find all the Star Pieces[1] and fix the Star Road, we can[1] kiss our dreams goodbye![0]
{2266}I:
{2267}	TOADSTOOL: WHAT?![1] This is dreadful news![1] Awful! Horrible...![5][6]
{2267}I:
{2268}	GENO: Indeed...for example...[2] Say Bowser kidnapped you.[1] Without the aid of the Star Road,[1] you'd probably never be rescued![0]
{2268}I:
{2269}	BOWSER: Actually, that sounds[1] pretty GOOD to me![1] Let's just forget about these...[2] Star...things![0]
{2269}I:
{2270}	TOADSTOOL: Great, Bowser. Then[1] you can just kiss your precious[1] “Keep” goodbye![0]
{2270}I:
{2271}	TOADSTOOL: Urgh!!![1] Just ignore that idiot![5][6]
{2271}I:
{2272}	[1] I just don't think I could take[1] a world without wishes...[5][6]
{2272}I:
{2273}	[4] We need to go and find[1] those Star Pieces, NOW![0]
{2273}I:
{2274}	TOADSTOOL: I don't care! Things[1] seem so hopeless right now...[0]
{2274}I:
{2275}	 I'm tired...[2] I think I need to lie down[1] in my room for awhile.[0]
{2275}I:
{2276}	TOADSTOOL: Mario...Mallow...[1] Geno and...Bowser, you too...[2] Good luck![0]
{2276}I:
{2277}	[1]                 Isn't it?[0]
{2277}I:
{2278}	 BOWSER:[1]             HUH?! WHAT?![0]
{2278}I:
{2279}	[4] Huh?[12][12] Let's see. If Mario[2] can't find the stars...[13][48][6]
{2279}I:
{2280}	[1] Toadstool will be MINE![13][32][6]
{2280}I:
{2281}	[1] But I won't get my Keep back...[13][32][6]
{2281}I:
{2282}	[1] unless Mario finds the stars![13][32][6]
{2282}I:
{2283}	[1] So if I want my Keep back...[6]
{2283}I:
{2284}	[1] we need those star things, but...[5][6]
{2284}I:
{2285}	[1] Huh?! Run that past me again![0]
{2285}I:
{2286}	CHANCELLOR: Princess![5][6]
{2286}I:
{2287}	 You CAN'T be serious![1] You're NOT thinking of[1] joining them, ARE YOU?[5][6]
{2287}I:
{2288}	 This is sheer madness...[1] You're a Princess![2] What will people say?![0]
{2288}I:

{2293}I:
{2294}	 Could it have been this “Smithy”[1] who attacked our Kingdom?[3] I fear we have no cause to[1] rejoice. In fact, Mario, we must[1] ask you for yet another favor...[0]
{2294}I:
{2295}	 Please...on behalf of all of us,[1] you MUST defeat Smithy...[3] It is the only way we shall ever[1] live in peace again.[0]

{2398}I:
{2399}	VALENTINA:[1]           Dear me...[12]...[12]...[12]...[13][48][6]
{2399}I:
{2400}	 I've made my decision...[2] At the request of the Prince,[1] I agree to become his queen.[0]

{2402}I:
{2403}	[1]       (Hurry it up, will ya?!)[0]
{2403}I:
{2404}	MALLOW: Can you believe it?![2] What a coincidence! There's a[1] prince with the same name as ME![0]
{2404}I:
{2405}	 Don't we have anything[1] better to do than hang around[1] HERE? Come on, let's go and[2] find the rest of the Star Pieces!![0]
{2405}I:
{2406}	VALENTINA: Introducing...[1] ...Prince Mallow![0]
{2406}I:
{2407}	 Say, you have that, “I'm looking[1] for something” look in your eyes.[2] What can I do for you?[0]
{2407}I:
{2408}	 You think you're sooo hot,[1] but...you're not![0]
{2408}I:
{2409}	 I used to work for King Nimbus,[1] but all of a sudden one day,[3] Valentina told me I was fired![1] I just don't get it...[1] He NEEDS help. He's sick...![0]
{2409}I:
{2410}	 I used to work in the castle.[1] You should see the way she hits[1] poor Dodo![3] What a horrible life he must live![0]
{2410}I:
{2411}	 That's Garro the sculptor's place.[1] He used to make all kinds of[1] things for King Nimbus![3] But these days, he has nothing but[1] time on his hands, what with the[1] King being sick and all...[0]
{2411}I:
{2412}	 Been a while since I saw Prince[1] Mallow...He's...changed, but[1] yes, I do believe that's him.[0]
{2412}I:
{2413}	 Was Prince Mallow that HEAVY?![2] Well, she says it's him,[1] so it must be him![0]
{2413}I:
{2414}	 Poor King Nimbus appears to be[1] a tad under the weather![0]
{2414}I:
{2415}	 I wonder why more people from the[1] world down under don't visit us[1] these days?[2] I hope it's nothing personal...[0]
{2415}I:
{2416}	 Why did Prince Mallow make[1] Valentina his queen?...I guess[2] it's because she found him.[0]
{2416}I:
{2417}	 You like the guards we have at the[1] entrance now? I don't. Never used[1] to have 'em...[0]
{2417}I:
{2418}	 I wish the King would get well![1] But at least the Prince is back[1] just in case something...awful[2] happens.[0]
{2418}I:
{2419}	 Hey! Who're YOU?!...[2] You can't just barge in here![0]
{2419}I:
{2420}	MALLOW:[1]          Hey look! It's ME![0]
{2420}I:
{2421}	GARRO: Oh, you mean THAT?[1] That's King Nimbus when he was...[1] [12][12]a[12][12] ...young lad.[13][48][5][6]
{2421}I:
{2422}	[4] ...What the...?![13][48]...[1] WHO are YOU...?![0]
{2422}I:
{2423}	GARRO: Mallow...[12][12][1] So it IS YOU, my boy![1] It's been so long. My, you've[2] become a splendid young prince![0]
{2423}I:
{2424}	MALLOW: WHAT?![1] I'm...I'm really a...prince?![0]
{2424}I:
{2425}	GARRO: I KNEW Valentina[1] was up to SOMETHING![1] I just didn't know what...[3] That must mean that the King[1] really ISN'T gravely ill...![0]
{2425}I:
{2426}	MALLOW: Then let's go inside[1] the castle and save my[1] mother and father![0]
{2426}I:
{2427}	GARRO: ...[12][12]Wait![1] I have an excellent idea.[2] Come over here...[0]
{2427}I:
{2428}	GARRO:[1]                 THERE![0]
{2428}I:
{2429}	[1]           Hey, don't move![0]
{2429}I:
{2430}	You're going to be a “statue” for[1]a while, okay?[0]
{2430}I:
{2431}	[1]          Let's get going now.[0]
{2431}I:
{2432}	[4][1]             ...[12]![12]...[12]! Huh?[12][12][13][48][6]
{2432}I:
{2433}	MALLOW: Hello.[1] My name is Mallow.[5][6]
{2433}I:
{2434}	[1] And this is my friend, Mario.[0]
{2434}I:
{2435}	GARRO: Yes indeed! I understand.[2] So! You were raised by Frogfucius![5][6]
{2435}I:
{2436}	[1] There's no question about it![1] You ARE, WITHOUT A DOUBT...[1] Prince Mallow.[0]
{2436}I:
{2437}	MALLOW: Mario! Look at me![1] I'm a prince![0]
{2437}I:
{2438}	[4] Just stay still for a little[1] while, okay? It won't take long.[0]
{2438}I:
{2439}	GARRO: Are you ready?[2] [7]  (Yes)[1] [7]  (No, not yet. Hang on)[0]
{2439}I:
{2440}	[4][1]          Okay, just say when.[0]
{2440}I:
{2441}	GARRO:[4][1]      All right, stand over here.[0]
{2441}I:
{2442}	[4][1]      All right, stand over here.[0]
{2442}I:
{2443}	[1]            Hold still, okay?[0]
{2443}I:
{2444}	 Hi. I'm the sculptor, Garro.[1] I used to make a lot of statues[1] of King Nimbus, but now,[3] all I get are orders for[1] sculptures of Valentina.[0]
{2444}I:
{2445}	 GARRO: I'm delivering Valentina's[1]  latest order to her.[0]
{2445}I:
{2446}	[1]              You may enter.[0]
{2446}I:
{2447}	 Hey, this doesn't look like[1] Valentina at all![0]
{2447}I:
{2448}	GARRO: Oh?! That's because[3] this is a statue of Valentina's[1] nephew, Mari..Mariotta![1] Okay?![0]
{2448}I:
{2449}	[1]         Uh...[12][12]okay.[12][12] Proceed.[0]
{2449}I:
{2450}	GARRO: Phew, that was close...[1] Didn't think we could get through[1] THAT ONE. There IS no such[2] person named Mariotta. Ha![0]
{2450}I:
{2451}	VALENTINA: Oh! Now THIS is[1] lovely! My beauty simply shines[1] forth like the sun! Only YOU can[2] make something THIS stunning![0]
{2451}I:
{2452}	GARRO: Thank you, your majesty.[2] I'll be on my way now...[0]
{2452}I:
{2453}	VALENTINA:[1]                  Halt![0]
{2453}I:
{2454}	[1] What, may I ask is THIS ugly thing?[0]
{2454}I:
{2455}	GARRO: OH! You mean[12]...[1] THAT...[12][12]That's ...um...[0]
{2455}I:
{2456}	 That's my latest masterpiece.[1] I...I created it just for[1] YOU...[5] It's called...[12][12][3] [1]        “A Plumber's Lament”[0]
{2456}I:
{2457}	 Observe...the thick mustache...[1] covering the sad, innocent smile[2] of a simple fool...[0]

{2630}I:
{2631}	 According to my source, it's[1] impossible to jump more than[1] 100 times.[3] You've proven your point, so[1] let's give this competition a[1] rest![0]

{2633}I:
{2634}	 Sometimes if you jump at the right[1] places, a treasure box will pop[1] out of thin air.[3] Anything like this happen to you?[3] These treasure boxes are known as[1] “Surprise Boxes”, because they[1] appear out of nowhere.[0]

{2659}I:
{2660}	 Can't wait to graduate from music[1] school and start composing![0]
{2660}I:
{2661}	 I haven't had one made yet.[0]
{2661}I:
{2662}	 I've got this dream...[2] of becoming a composer...[3] I want to be as famous as[1] Toadofsky![0]
{2662}I:
{2663}	 My favorite song?[0]
{2663}I:
{2664}	 It's Frogfucius' suite #18.[1] [37]“So La Mi Re Do Re Do Re”.[1] Toadofsky's fond of it, too![0]
{2664}I:
{2665}	 It's the Moleville miners' song,[1] [37]“Mi Do So Do Re La Ti Do”.[1] It's got soul![0]
{2665}I:
{2666}	 You're a first timer, aren't you?[2] Listen up. The green coins you find[1] periodically are Frog Coins.[3] Accumulate them and you can buy[1] items at Tadpole Pond.[0]

{2667}	 Hi![1] Welcome to Tadpole Pond.[2] Who are you?[0]

{2669}	 Mallow, it's you![3] We've heard all about your[1] adventures with Super Mario.[2] You guys beat up Belome, right?[0]
{2669}I:
{2670}	MALLOW: You know about that?[3] See Mario, the waterways of[1] the world bring news to us here.[3] That's why Grandpa knows[1] all the news that's fit to hear![0]
{2670}I:
{2671}	 Are you really THE Super Mario?[3] Hey everybody![1] You'll never guess who's here![0]
{2671}I:
{2672}	 Sorry, Tadpole Pond items are all[1] sold out![3] Thanks for coming by.[0]
{2672}I:
{2673}	 Oops, I forgot the rest.[0]
{2673}I:
{2674}	 I heard your composition, and it's[1] pretty good.[0]
{2674}I:
{2675}	 Hi![1] Can I help you?[0]
{2675}I:
{2676}	 He's the real thing![1] But he doesn't look anything like[1] I thought he would...[0]

{2679}I:
{2680}	 They DO say he can jump better[1] than a froggie.[1] I wonder if it's only a rumor?[0]
{2680}I:
{2681}	FROGFUCIUS: Well, grasshopper...[1] What's new?[0]
{2681}I:
{2682}	MALLOW: Grandpa![1] Mario's been helping me![0]
{2682}I:
{2683}	FROGFUCIUS: Welcome![5][1] So you are Mario, yes?[1] I am Frogfucius.[3] You have come to seek wisdom[1] from me, have you not?[1] I've been waiting for you![3] Yes, “Old Wise People” can often[1] give good advice...[0]
{2683}I:
{2684}	FROGFUCIUS: I know, child.[2] That rainstorm we just had...[1] that was YOU wasn't it?[0]
{2684}I:
{2685}	FROGFUCIUS: But how rude of me![1] Let's get more comfortable.[1] Come along and we'll talk.[3][1]        (Clear! Full reverse!)[0]
{2685}I:
{2686}	 Tadpoles! Don't just FLOAT there![1] Make yourselves useful![5][1] Form a bridge for Mario.[0]
{2686}I:
{2687}	[1]                (Ouch!)[3][1]        (Watch it, up there!)[3](You're SUPPOSED to make me look[1]  like I'm FLOATING here, okay?!)[0]
{2687}I:
{2688}	FROGFUCIUS: Yes, come into my[1] sanctuary and partake of my[1] wisdom, children.[0]
{2688}I:
{2689}	FROGFUCIUS: Yes, come into my[1] sanctuary and partake of my[1] wisdom, children.[0]
{2689}I:
{2690}	FROGFUCIUS: Let's see...[3] That Smithy character that[1] appeared at Bowser's Keep...[1] He is quite formidable, yes?[3] And, Mario, you wish to rescue[1] the princess quickly, do you not?[3] But, oh![1] If only you knew the truth![5][1] Toadstool is no longer there![0]
{2690}I:
{2691}	 Patience, young one.[2] Let me explain.[1] Here is what happened...[0]
{2691}I:
{2692}	 Whoosh, out of the blue![3] The shock sent the three of you[1] flying.[3] Bowser and Toadstool are still[1] lost, somewhere out there.[2] Now...[0]
{2692}I:
{2693}	 You're worried about the princess,[1] but first you need to take care[1] of Smithy.[3] His underlings are wreaking havoc[1] in our world![3] “Mack”, whom you defeated at[1] Mushroom Kingdom, was one of[1] them. More will be coming.[0]
{2693}I:
{2694}	MALLOW: Grandpa, I almost forgot[1] to tell ya something![2] We found a star in the castle at[1] Mushroom Kingdom.[1] Do you know why it was there?[0]
{2694}I:
{2695}	FROGFUCIUS: A star, eh...[1] ...most interesting.[3] This may sound illogical, but I[1] believe shooting stars can[1] grant wishes...[3] And now more than ever, I believe[1] they will play a vital role in[1] the fight against Smithy.[0]
{2695}I:
{2696}	MALLOW: Wow, everything sounds[1] so dire and serious.[3] I guess Mack was only the first[1] of many, Mario. Some of them'll[1] make Bowser seem NICE.[0]
{2696}I:
{2697}	 You were rescuing Toadstool from[1] Bowser's Keep.[3] After defeating him, and JUST[1] when you were about to free the[1] princess...[3] You heard a loud “crash”, and[1] saw a huge sword split the sky![0]
{2697}I:
{2698}	FROGFUCIUS: Mallow, you speak as[1] if these things do not concern you.[3] You will accompany Mario on his[1] adventure, too.[0]
{2698}I:
{2699}	MALLOW: Grandpa![1] What are you talking about?[3] I'm only a simple tadpole![1] This adventure isn't for me![0]
{2699}I:
{2700}	FROGFUCIUS: Mallow, my boy,[1] I've kept this from you until now,[5][1] but you're...[3][1]           [12][12][12][12] Not a tadpole!!![0]
{2700}I:
{2701}	 I was sitting here one rainy day,[1] enjoying a snack of crickets...[3] When I happened to see a basket[1] floating down from the falls.[3] I peeked inside, and saw a little[1] baby staring right back at me![1] The name “Mallow” was written[3] on his belt. I felt sorry for the[1] little bundle of puff and took him[1] in to raise as my own grandchild.[3] He had powerful magic, and I knew[1] he was more than a piece of fluff.[3] I thought,“Surely, this child must[1] be from some far off land.”[0]
{2701}I:
{2702}	MALLOW: Grandpa...[1] You mean, I'm not...a tadpole?[3][12][12]Sniffle...[1]               [12][12]sniffle...[1]                             [12][12]sniffle...[0]
{2702}I:
{2703}	FROGFUCIUS: Mallow![2] Now is not the time to cry![3] Go with Mario on his adventure[1] and find your real family.[3] Your real mother and father are[1] out there, somewhere.[0]
{2703}I:
{2704}	FROGFUCIUS: (Psst, Mario)[0]
{2704}I:
{2705}	 The boy's magic is sure to come in[1] handy on your adventure.[1] You'll take him along, yes?[0]
{2705}I:
{2706}	MALLOW: Grandpa![3] I won't cry anymore.[1] I'll go on this adventure with[1] Mario and find my real family![0]
{2706}I:
{2707}	[1]            Say WHAT???[1][0]
{2707}I:
{2708}	FROGFUCIUS: Then it is settled.[1] You must embark on your adventure[1] immediately.[3] First, go to “Rose Town” where[1] they need your help.[0]
{2708}I:
{2709}	 That's right![1] I had forgotten all about it.[3] I will give you something for the[1] Cricket Pie you brought back.[3] [12][43][12][43][12]Ah, I know![1] You shall have the staff I used[1] when I was Mallow's age.[0]
{2709}I:
{2710}	FROGFUCIUS:[1] Go to “Rose Town” now, Mallow.[1] Luck be with you![0]
{2710}I:
{2711}	FROGFUCIUS: The “Froggie Stick”[1] will come in handy.[2] Do not forget to equip it.[0]
{2711}I:
{2712}	FROGFUCIUS: Grasshopper, do you[1] not think it rude to stand on my[1] dining table?[0]
{2712}I:
{2713}	 Welcome to the “Frog Coin”[1] emporium![0]
{2713}I:
{2714}	TOADOFSKY: Hmmm.[1] Was that your song I just heard?[0]
{2714}I:
{2715}	 It won't do at all![1] It is not the masterpiece I am[1] trying to compose![0]
{2715}I:
{2716}	 It won't do at all![1] It is not the masterpiece I am[1] trying to compose![0]
{2716}I:
{2717}	 You're on your way to composing![0]
{2717}I:
{2718}	[1]       So La Mi Re Do Re Do Re [0]
{2718}I:
{2719}	TOADOFSKY: You want a music[1] lesson from MOI?[2]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (Nope)[0]
{2719}I:
{2720}	 Let's start by reading “notes”.[1] See the five lines?[3] Between the second and third lines[1] from the top, lies “Do”.[3] Keep going up, and the notes are[1] “Do Re Mi”. Go down and you'll[1] get “Do Ti La So Fa”.[0]
{2720}I:
{2721}	 Well, be that way![0]
{2721}I:
{2722}	              Play notes by[1]       jumping on the tadpoles.[2]        Let's hear your melody.[0]
{2722}I:
{2723}	FROGFUCIUS: (Snif) It will be quiet[1] around here with Mallow gone.[2] Maybe a snack will cheer me up.[0]
{2723}I:
{2724}	TOADOFSKY:[1] Is that something you composed?[0]
{2724}I:
{2725}	 It's not what I'm looking for.[1] It won't do at all.[0]
{2725}I:
{2726}	 No, that's not the right melody.[0]
{2726}I:
{2727}	 That sort of resembles the melody[1] I'm thinking of.[0]
{2727}I:
{2728}	 That's remarkably similar to what[1] I have in mind.[0]
{2728}I:
{2729}	 Now that is amazingly close to my[1] dream composition![0]
{2729}I:
{2730}	TOADOFSKY: That's it!![3] This is the melody I've been[1] looking for.[1] Thank you for the inspiration![0]
{2730}I:
{2731}	 Please take this as a token of my[1] gratitude.[0]
{2731}I:
{2732}	 I am the composer, Toadofsky.[3] I am trying to create my next[1] masterpiece but I've got[1] composer's block.[0]
{2732}I:
{2733}	  They won't play with strangers,[1] so go and meet Frogfucius first.[0]
{2733}I:
{2734}	TOADOFSKY: If I ever need help with[1] my compositions again, I'll look[1] for you here.[2] Until then, adieu![0]
{2734}I:
{2735}	FROGFUCIUS: Looks like your help[1] is needed in “Moleville”.[1] Go and see what you can do.[0]

{2739}I:

{2740}I:

{2741}I:

{2747}	TOAD: Boy that was a close call.[2] Here's a token of my appreciation.[0]
{2747}I:
{2748}	TOAD: Thanks for saving me![1] In my rush to tell the Chancellor,[1] I didn't watch where I was going.[2] Mushroom Kingdom's just ahead,[1] Mario. Let's hurry there.[0]
{2748}I:
{2749}	              Get an item![0]
{2749}I:
{2750}	 Ahem, then please allow me.[2] In order to use items, open up[1] the “Menu” screen.[2] With it, you can check your status[1] and coin count.[3] Push “X” to open it.[6]
{2750}I:	 Ahem, fammi spiegare, allora.[2] Per usare gli oggetti, apri il[1] “Menù”.[2] Così facendo potrai controllare lo[1] stato e le tue monete.[3] Premi “X”, il pulsante circolare[1] blu, per aprirlo.[6]
{2751}	      Received a “Tenor Card”[0]
{2751}I:
{2752}	       Received a “Mushroom”![0]
{2752}I:
{2753}	    Received three “Mushrooms”![0]
{2753}I:
{2754}	             Got a “Chomp”[0]
{2754}I:
{2755}	     Received a “Soprano Card”[0]
{2755}I:
{2756}	TOAD: Mario![1] You're forgetting something.[1] Come with me and I'll show you.[0]
{2756}I:
{2757}	TOAD: Mario![1] You're forgetting something.[1] Come with me and I'll show you.[0]
{2757}I:
{2758}	TOAD: Before you start off, it's[1] best to jump up on these boxes[1] and “Save” as often as possible.[3] In case of an emergency, you can[1] always start over from the last[1] place you saved.[0]
{2758}I:
{2759}	TOAD: Hey Mario![2] Lots of people use something[1] called a “door” to go in and out[1] of their houses...[3] Anyway, I came by to pick up[1] Toadstool, since she's a bit late.[0]
{2759}I:	TOAD: Mario![2] È buona educazione usare una[1] “porta” per entrare in[1] casa.[3] Comunque, visto il ritardo, sono[1] venuto a prendere Peach.[1] Deve tornare al Regno prima che inizino a preoccuparsi![0]
{2760}	TOAD: Hey I thought the princess[1] was here with you, Mario![1] So where is she?[0]
{2760}I:	TOAD: Ehi! Pensavo che la[1] Principessa fosse qui con te,[1] Mario! Quindi, dov'è?[0]
{2761}	 Mario, what's with the silent[1] treatment?![2] You're not telling me something.[3] [12][12]It's Bowser again, isn't it?[2] Oh no, here we go again![3] Mario, would you please bring her[1] back, like you always do?[0]
{2761}I:	 Mario![2] Ti conosco, so cosa è successo![3] [12][12]C'entra di nuovo Bowser, vero?[2] Oh, no, quello là non impara mai![3] Mario, lo punirai come fai sempre,[1] vero?[0]
{2762}	TOAD: If you're tired, just turn off[1] the “Fungi Light” for a snooze.[0]
{2762}I:	TOAD: Se sei stanco, spegni la[1] “Fungolampada” e riposa.[0]
{2763}	TOAD: You're back so soon![1] Did you forget something?[3] No?[12][12] What happened then?[0]
{2763}I:	TOAD: Sei tornato presto![1] Hai dimenticato qualcosa?[3] No?[12][12] Cosa succede allora?[0]
{2764}	TOAD: The bridge to Bowser's Keep[1] is out now?[2] Just wonderful...[3] We must inform the Chancellor of[1] Mushroom Kingdom at once![1] Let's go, Mario.[0]
{2764}I:	TOAD: Il ponte del Castello di[1] Bowser è crollato?[2] Che bello...[3] Dobbiamo dirlo subito al Ministro[1] del Regno dei Funghi![1] Forza, andiamo![0]
{2765}	TOAD: Oops, excuse me![3] [43][12]Oh?[5][1] That bump on your head reduced[1] your “HP” level.[3] One of Mushroom Kingdom's[1] famous items ought to perk you[1] right up![0]
{2765}I:	TOAD: Oops, scusami![3] [43][12]Eh?[5][1] La botta che hai preso in testa ha[1] diminuito i tuoi “PV”.[3] In aiuto ecco una specialità[1] del Regno dei Funghi![0]
{2766}	 Do you know how to use items?[1]  [7] (I have no idea)[1]  [7] (Of course I do!)[0]
{2766}I:	 Sai come si usano gli oggetti?[1]  [7] (Non ne ho idea)[1]  [7] (Mi pare ovvio!)[0]
{2767}	        The door won't budge.[0]
{2767}I:
{2768}	  They gaze into each other's eyes.[0]
{2768}I:
{2769}	BOWSER: Mario, she's a bit shy.[2] Look the other way, will you?[0]
{2769}I:
{2770}	BOOSTER: [1]                [12][12]A...[12][12]ha![0]
{2770}I:
{2771}	TOADSTOOL: What should we do?![3] Booster is returning, isn't he?[2] I know! Hide somewhere and wait[1] until he opens the door.[0]
{2771}I:
{2772}	BOOSTER: Right![3] Now, about the girl in my life,[1] who thinks I should marry her?[3] Well?[2] Speak up![0]
{2772}I:
{2773}	SNIFIT 2: A wedding ceremony[1] would make a great PARTY![0]
{2773}I:
{2774}	BOOSTER:[1] Ah, a party![2] We haven't had one of those.[3] It could be fun![2] So...what is a party?[0]
{2774}I:
{2775}	SNIFIT 3: Well, you drink punch[1] and eat CAKE![1] ...I think.[0]
{2775}I:
{2776}	SNIFIT 1: Boss, shouldn't we be[1] concentrating on the girl?[0]
{2776}I:
{2777}	BOOSTER: Hmmm...[2] Drink punch...eat cake...?[1] It sounds...complicated.[3] I don't know if I can muster the[1] energy to do it...[2] Let's walk through it once![1] It's wedding rehearsal time![0]
{2777}I:
{2778}	SNIFIT 1: [1] We will now begin the ceremony.[3] Walk down the aisle with the...[1] (hey someone make her smile!)[1] beautiful bride-to-be.[0]
{2778}I:
{2779}	BOOSTER: Wait![2] Mario always shows up about now[1] to ruin the fun.[3] We've got to take that into[1] consideration, you know.[2] Someone go and get the Mario doll.[0]
{2779}I:
{2780}	         You can move freely[1]         behind the curtains.[3]   Good luck hiding from Booster[1]            and his Snifits.[0]
{2780}I:
{2781}	SNIFITS: [1]              It isn't here.[0]
{2781}I:
{2782}	BOOSTER: Of course it's here![1] You lazy slobs couldn't find water[1] if you were fish![0]
{2782}I:
{2783}	 It's behind those curtains![2] Number one, you go and look.[0]
{2783}I:
{2784}	SNIFIT 1: [1]          Nope, it isn't here.[0]
{2784}I:
{2785}	SNIFIT 1: [1]          Nope, it isn't here.[0]
{2785}I:
{2786}	BOOSTER: I wouldn't go and lose[1] my Mario doll, you idiots![3] Argh!![2] Number two, YOU look, too![0]
{2786}I:
{2787}	BOOSTER: We can't give up![1] It's gotta be here somewhere.[3] Number 3![1] It's your turn![0]
{2787}I:
{2788}	SNIFITS 1 & 2: [1]          Nope, it isn't here.[0]
{2788}I:
{2789}	BOOSTER: Wait a minute![0]
{2789}I:
{2790}	BOOSTER: [1] This is better than a party![2] Look out, 'cause here I come![0]
{2790}I:
{2791}	BOOSTER: Wait [5]a [5]second![2] It's right up there.[1] I found the Mario doll![0]
{2791}I:
{2792}	BOOSTER: But we'll NEVER be[1] able to reach it up there.[2] Oh! The sorrow![0]
{2792}I:
{2793}	 What AM I gonna do...?[0]
{2793}I:
{2794}	 I'm about to lose it...sniffle...[0]
{2794}I:
{2795}	BOOSTER: Goodness![2] You're so kind![1] Thank you for getting my doll.[0]
{2795}I:
{2796}	 I'd like to reward you.[2] Here, take this.[0]
{2796}I:
{2797}	           Got an “Amulet”[0]
{2797}I:
{2798}	BOOSTER: May happiness follow[1] you, wherever you go.[0]
{2798}I:
{2799}	 All right! Enough is enough...[2] Cancel the rehearsal, we're going[1] on with the show![0]
{2799}I:
{2800}	BOOSTER: Here's the password![3][1]               [12][12][12][28][3][1][0]
{2800}I:
{2801}	         Need the key to get in[0]
{2801}I:
{2802}	          Got the “Room Key”[0]
{2802}I:
{2803}	BOOSTER: G'na!!![2]               It's Mario![3] That's impossible![1] He made it past all my traps...[2] But we're gonna trip him up![0]
{2803}I:
{2804}	BOOSTER: I'd love to stay and[1] chat, but I've a schedule to keep.[2] Move aside so I can open that[1] door.[0]
{2804}I:
{2805}	BOWSER:[1] Booster has such a nice place...[1] I miss my fortress...[3] I miss the good old days...[2] Toadstool screaming in terror,[1] Mario rushing in to save her...[0]
{2805}I:
{2806}	BOWSER:[1] Booster has such a nice place...[1] I miss my fortress...[3] I miss the good old days...[2] Toadstool screaming in terror,[1] Mario rushing in to save her...[0]
{2806}I:
{2807}	 Oh geez, it's Mario![3] Oops[43][5] Okay, okay[43][5] Calm down![5][1] Don't let him see you like this![3] [1] [12][12]    “Hey, how have you been?”[3] NO! Not like that, dummy![5][1] Wrong tone![1] It needs more...confidence![0]
{2807}I:
{2808}	BOWSER: ...[2] That voice! It's Toadstool![3] I thought she got away, but[1] she's been stuck HERE...[1] Mwa, ha, ha![3] Well...[2] I guess I'll be returning to my[1] castle now.[0]
{2808}I:
{2809}	 YOU!![1] What're YOU doing HERE?![3] If...[5] Toadstool were at my[1] castle waiting to be rescued...[2] She'd be crying like a baby![0]
{2809}I:
{2810}	[1]        Outta my way, shortie![0]
{2810}I:
{2811}	               It's locked[0]
{2811}I:
{2812}	BOWSER: What!?[1] You're STILL here?[3] That look on your face...[2] Mwa, ha, ha![1] I get it now![0]
{2812}I:
{2813}	BOWSER: Yeah...[1] I'm a piece of work, ain't I?![3] All this power, AND looks too![1] I know, I know! You're thinking,[3] “A big strong guy like him would[1] be great to have along!” right?[2] I'm gonna do something I may[1] regret later...![0]
{2813}I:
{2814}	 I'll let you join the “Koopa Troop”.[1] You can thank me later...[0]
{2814}I:
{2815}	     Mario and his friends have[1]     joined the “Koopa Troop”![2]     (Or so they're pretending)[3] [1]      “Bowser” joins the group[0]
{2815}I:
{2816}	BOWSER: You can turn around now.[0]
{2816}I:
{2817}	BOWSER: She says she's been[1] locked up ever since she took a[1] bite out of Booster. So now...[3] She wants to help us stir up a[1] little trouble![1] Mwa, ha, ha!![0]
{2817}I:
{2818}	BOOSTER: Hey everybody![2] Did you see someone behind the[1] curtains, or was it just me?[3] How creepy![1] It's a pain, but I think we should[1] check one more time.[0]
{2818}I:
{2819}	BOOSTER: Well?[2] I really think someone's behind[1] those curtains![3] I think one more peek is necessary.[0]
{2819}I:
{2820}	          Got the Room Key[0]
{2820}I:
{2821}	      Take a look at Booster's[1]   family portraits in order from[1]     the oldest to the youngest.[0]
{2821}I:
{2822}	  Remember to respect your elders.[0]
{2822}I:
{2823}	TOADSTOOL: Oh?[0]
{2823}I:
{2824}	 Did I just hear some voices?[3] It couldn't be...![0]
{2824}I:
{2825}	 I can't believe it![2] It's...Mario![0]
{2825}I:
{2826}	[1]             [12][12] Mario~!!![3][1]            [12][12] I'm up here![0]
{2826}I:
{2827}	TOADSTOOL: Mario![2] You DID come to rescue me.[1] I was so frightened and lonely.[3] [12][12]But now that you're here...[0]
{2827}I:
{2828}	TOADSTOOL: The door won't open?[3] I think we need Booster's spell[1] to undo the lock on it.[1] Oh, what should we do?[0]
{2828}I:
{2829}	BOOSTER:[2] Ah~[5] HA[5][12]~[12]~[12]~[12]~[12]~[12]~[12]~[12]![12][0]
{2829}I:
{2830}	ELDER: Found the pirate ship?[2] Don't give up now, the star is[1] almost in your hands.[0]
{2830}I:
{2831}	ELDER: Found the pirate ship?[2] Don't give up now, the star is[1] almost in your hands.[0]
{2831}I:
{2832}	 This is...the inn.[1] You may stay...for free.[2]  [7] (Thanks)[1]  [7] (I'll pass)[0]
{2832}I:
{2833}	 Okay...[0]
{2833}I:
{2834}	 They keep...spinning and spinning.[0]
{2834}I:
{2835}	 Don't...tell me.[1] You want...supplies.[1] I know.[0]
{2835}I:
{2836}	 Thank you...very much.[0]
{2836}I:
{2837}	 If you...want to enter the ocean,[1] jump into...the whirlpools.[0]
{2837}I:
{2838}	 You will find the village elder...[1] in his house. He is...the most[1] respected person here.[0]
{2838}I:
{2839}	 You're...collecting stars, right?[1] Only...three more to go.[0]
{2839}I:
{2840}	ELDER: Finally![2] It took you long enough![3] I am the ELDER of this village.[3] I got to my exalted station in life[1] by...pleasing my superiors,[1] which is something I do well.[3] A star has fallen into the ocean.[1] I need it for...a certain purpose.[2] You...must find it for me.[0]
{2840}I:
{2841}	 In the middle...of the ocean is a[1] pirate...ship.[2] You'll find a...I mean, there's a...[0]
{2841}I:
{2842}	 ...A pirate lives there![1] His name is...“Jonathan Jones”...[1] ...[5]He isn't...very nice...[0]
{2842}I:
{2843}	 A star...has fallen into the sea.[2] The pirate...probably...[0]
{2843}I:
{2844}	 I mean that...man...[1] ...Uh...“Jonathan Jones”...[1] probably...has it.[5] He's nasty.[0]
{2844}I:
{2845}	 I'm...just a...customer.[0]
{2845}I:
{2846}	ELDER: You'll find the star in[1] “Jonathan Jones'” territory.[1] Don't worry, you can beat him.[3] (At least I THINK you can.)[1] Hurry and bring back the star![0]
{2846}I:
{2847}	 You...may not enter here.[1] This is...a restricted area.[0]
{2847}I:
{2848}	 There is nothing of interest here.[1] Don't...bother looking inside.[0]
{2848}I:
{2849}	                   Hey![2]          Someone's in there.[0]
{2849}I:
{2850}	ELDER: Eee hee hee![2] You found the star![1] Well done![3] But your journey ends here.[1] You are so gullible![1] Don't you know who I am?[3] I'm “Yaridovich”, a member of[1] Smithy's gang.[2] Shocked?[3] It's no wonder![1] My impersonation of an ordinary[1] person was flawless.[0]
{2850}I:
{2851}	YARIDOVICH: Your search for the[1] stars has worried Smithy.[3] So if I take that star back to him,[1] I'll earn brownie points.[1] THIS is the way to get ahead![0]
{2851}I:
{2852}	 It's futile to try and fight me.[1] Just hand it over, nice and easy.[2]  [7] (Okay)[1]  [7] (Get serious!)[0]
{2852}I:
{2853}	 So that's how you want to play it?[2] What do you think will happen[1] to the real inhabitants of[1] Seaside Town?[0]
{2853}I:
{2854}	REAL ELDER: [1] What are you doing?[2] No! Don't do that![3][1]           [12]No please stop![3][1][12][12][12][12]            [43][12]ACK![12][43][12][43][12][43][0]
{2854}I:
{2855}	YARIDOVICH: Now isn't it a shame[1] for an innocent old man to be[1] tickled...like this?[0]
{2855}I:
{2856}	REAL ELDER: [1] No you wouldn't![2] The two of you are going to???[3] [12][12]Nooo![1] Please not there![3][1][12][12][12][12]        [43][12][43][12]Aiee[12][43][12][43][12][43][12]ee[43][12][43][12][43][12][0]
{2856}I:
{2857}	REAL ELDER: [1] Harumph![2] You can't treat me this way![3] [12][12][12][12][12][12]Ayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiieeeeeeeeee[1] aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiyaaaaaaaaaaaaa[1] aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa[12]e[12]e[12][12]e[12][12]e[12][12][43][12][12][43][3] [1]        [12][12]I can't bear[12] this[12]![12][43][12][12][12][43][0]
{2857}I:
{2858}	REAL ELDER:[1] [12][43][12][43][12][43][12][43][12][43][12][43][0]
{2858}I:
{2859}	YARIDOVICH: Eee hee hee![2] And to think I got the star without[1] even soiling my hands![3] I'm such a genius, it scares me[1] sometimes.[3] No wonder I'm so important![3] All right everyone, listen up.[1] We're returning to the castle![2] Our ride should be here about now.[0]
{2859}I:
{2860}	YARIDOVICH: Blade's late.[2] What's taking him so long?[3] We need to get out of here.[0]
{2860}I:
{2861}	YARIDOVICH: This is JUST great![2] Mario caught up with us.[3] Only one thing we can do now.[1] Although we may rust a little,[1] we'll have to swim for it.[0]
{2861}I:
{2862}	JOHNNY: Not so fast there![2] That star's a gift to me mate,[1] Mario.[3] You spineless dogs have no[1] code of honor![3] We'll make you walk the plank![0]
{2862}I:
{2863}	YARIDOVICH: Eee hee...![2] I guess we'll have to take our[1] disguises off now...[3] [1]          GROUP formation![0]
{2863}I:
{2864}	 Johnny, maybe we should leave[1] Mario the pleasure of wrapping[1] things up here.[0]
{2864}I:
{2865}	          Got the “Shed Key”[0]
{2865}I:
{2866}	               It's locked[0]
{2866}I:
{2867}	               It's locked[0]
{2867}I:
{2868}	 Welcome to “Beetles Are Us”![3] We run a beetle business here.[3] Want an explanation?[1]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (No)[0]
{2868}I:
{2869}	 Ok, I'll explain the system.[3] First you need to purchase a[1] “Beetle Box”, which will cost you[1] 50 coins.[3] Then go to Booster Hill, where[1] there are many beetles.[3] If you bring back the Beetle Box[1] filled with beetles, you can trade[1] them in for coins, etc.[3] Check the menu list for more[1] information.[0]
{2869}I:
{2870}	 Please come again.[0]
{2870}I:
{2871}	 Welcome to “Beetles Are Us”![0]
{2871}I:
{2872}	 If this is your first time, you need[1] to pay an initiation fee.[3] The fee is 100 coins.[1] Together with the 50 coins for[1] the Beetle Box, that's 150 coins.[3] Is it a deal?[1]  [7] (Ouch! Well, okay...)[1]  [7] (No, I'll pass)[0]
{2872}I:
{2873}	 Come back with more CASH![0]
{2873}I:
{2874}	 Thank you.[3] I need to see some ID please.[0]
{2874}I:
{2875}	 Everything looks fine.[3] Here's your Beetle Box.[1] Good luck, and happy hunting![0]
{2875}I:
{2876}	 You haven't even caught one?[1] Come on! Get serious![0]
{2876}I:
{2877}	 A Beetle Box costs 50 coins.[2]  [7] (Okay)[1]  [7] (No thanks)[0]
{2877}I:
{2878}	 Well then good luck to you![0]
{2878}I:
{2879}	 Good job![2] You made [28][0] coin(s).[0]
{2879}I:
{2880}	 Oh wow![2] You've got a Golden Beetle, too![1] Here's one Frog Coin.[0]
{2880}I:
{2881}	 Good doing business with you.[0]
{2881}I:
{2882}	 Good doing business with you.[0]
{2882}I:
{2883}	 Phew, thanks so much![2] I've had enough of cramped,[1] dirty old places like this.[0]
{2883}I:
{2884}	 Hey fella![2] You got us out of a bind![1] Peace brother![0]
{2884}I:
{2885}	 It was mighty unpleasant in here.[2] Thanks for helpin' us out.[0]
{2885}I:
{2886}	 Thank you![2] Yeah, thanks a lot![3] Be sure to stop by.[2] Yeah, stop on by.[0]
{2886}I:

{2887}I:
{2888}	ELDER: Ah, Mario.[3] Thank you for saving our little[1] town of Seaside.[0]
{2888}I:
{2889}	 You exposed the fake townspeople,[1] and gave up your star to save us![3] Please take this with our thanks.[0]
{2889}I:
{2890}	 They did torture me a little,[1] but it's nothing to worry about.[3] Here, this is for you.[0]
{2890}I:
{2891}	 Although they tortured me, I'm[1] sure it was nothing compared to[1] your trials, Mario.[3] I'd hate to have to go through[1] that tickle torture again, though![3] I've gotta leave now, so please[1] take this.[0]
{2891}I:
{2892}	 Being the most important person[1] in the village, it was inevitable[1] that I would be tortured.[3] Are you immune to tickle tortures,[1] Mario?[3] Oh yes...this is for you.[1] Please take it.[0]
{2892}I:

{2898}I:

{2899}I:
{2900}	 Hi, Mario![3] We've got a lot of health foods[1] at our store.[1] You gotta treat your body right![0]
{2900}I:
{2901}	 Welcome to our store.[1] We encourage healthy lifestyles.[0]
{2901}I:
{2902}	 Hey there![1] Remember me from the mines?[2] I found some neat stuff and I'm[1] opening up a “Miner's Store”.[3] Come and take a look at what[1] I've got to sell.[0]
{2902}I:
{2903}	 Oh hello there![2] You were so brave to rescue us,[1] and I'm so thankful...[3] But listen...maybe it's time you[1] thought a little more about[1] what you...wear...[3] Accessorizing is big business[1] these days![1] See anything you like here?[0]
{2903}I:
{2904}	 Let's see if we can't make you[1] look a little more snazzy.[1] That blue-collar look is SO dated! [0]
{2904}I:
{2905}	 Good to see you again.[2] I'll show you my inventory.[0]
{2905}I:
{2906}	 Please come in and browse.[1] I'm running an armor shop![0]
{2906}I:
{2907}	 Welcome to my weapons shop.[0]
{2907}I:
{2908}	 Item #2: A “Mystery Egg”.[1] I have no idea what it does![1] It sort of grows on ya, huh?[2] It's yours for 200 coins.[1]  [7] (Okay)[1]  [7] (No thanks)[0]
{2908}I:
{2909}	 That's all I've got for now.[0]
{2909}I:
{2910}	 You need more coins![2] I gotta eat, you know![0]
{2910}I:
{2911}	 Item #1: A “Lucky Jewel”![1] It's sure to bring you plenty of[1] good luck.[2] I'll sell it to you for 100 coins.[1]  [7] (It's a deal)[1]  [7] (I'll pass)[0]
{2911}I:
{2912}	 Nice doing business with you.[1] Here you go![0]
{2912}I:
{2913}	 Oops, I didn't realize I was out[1] of inventory.[3] Check back with me occasionally.[1] You may find something you like![0]
{2913}I:
{2914}	 Item #3: A “Metal Plate”.[2] Don't know what it's used for,[1] but I'll sell it for 300 coins.[1]  [7] (I'll take it)[1]  [7] (No thanks)[0]
{2914}I:
{2915}	 Mario, how nice of you to stop by.[3] It's quite a trek from your place,[1] isn't it?[3] Out here, there aren't many people[1] passing through, so it gets awful[1] lonely sometimes...[0]
{2915}I:
{2916}	 Please rest up before you go.[1] It'll only cost you 15 coins.[2]  [7] (Okay)[1]  [7] (No)[0]
{2916}I:
{2917}	 Okay, some other time then.[1] Have a safe trip.[0]
{2917}I:
{2918}	 You don't have enough coins?[3] That's ok, just pay me whatever[1] you can.[1] I know you need to rest.[0]
{2918}I:
{2919}	 Hello there.[2] You're Mario, right?[3] Do you remember me?[1] We met at Tadpole Pond, when I[1] was still a tadpole.[3] I've graduated from Frogfucius'[1] school, and now I'm searching for[1] the meaning of life.[0]
{2919}I:
{2920}	 It's been so quiet around here,[1] it's almost eerie...[1] Is something going on?[3] [12][12][12]It probably doesn't concern me.[1] But if you have any Frog Coins,[1] I've got some neat items to sell.[0]
{2920}I:
{2921}	 Good to see you again.[1] Did you have a chance to[1] accumulate many Frog Coins?[0]
{2921}I:
{2922}	 It was really quiet around here[1] until a little while ago.[1] What happened?[3] [12][12][12]That reminds me, do you have[1] any Frog Coins?[1] I've got some special items to sell.[0]
{2922}I:
{2923}	ELDER: Smithy and his gang have[1] disrupted business around here.[3] Why don't you help us out and do[1] some shopping before you leave?[0]
{2923}I:
{2924}	ELDER: Mario, if it's a star that[1] you're looking for, I may be able[1] to help you.[3] At the far side of “Land's End”[1] is a town made up of reformed[1] monsters.[3] A mouse came by the other day,[1] and I overheard him boasting[1] about a “star” of theirs.[3] I don't know exactly where this[1] town is located, but if you follow[1] the road, you'll get there.[0]
{2924}I:
{2925}	 By the way, have you met my, uh,[1] long-term houseguest, who's taken[1] over my second floor?[0]
{2925}I:
{2926}	 Speaking of items, it looks like[1] you've got too many and can't[1] carry them all.[0]
{2926}I:
{2927}	 Oops, sorry I'm all out of items.[3] In other words,[1]          “Come back later!”[2] So...good day to you![0]
{2927}I:
{2928}	 Hey, hey, HEY!![2] I'm the Mushroom Boy![3] Did you know that hidden amongst[1] the regular mushrooms, are some[1] special ones? Unreal huh?[3] I'll give you items in return for[1] those special mushrooms.[3] But you've got to taste them to[1] find out what kind they are.[2] So I'll take a nibble first.[3] I'm hoping for a special mushroom,[1] but even if it isn't, at least I'll[1] get a meal out of it.[0]
{2928}I:
{2929}	 You have any mushrooms?[1]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (Nope)[0]
{2929}I:
{2930}	 Hey, far out![1] Munch munch munch.[0]
{2930}I:
{2931}	 That was just a regular mushroom![1] Thanks for the snack.[0]
{2931}I:
{2932}	 Ooh![2] This one's a “Berry Mushroom”![3] I'll give you a “Maple Syrup”.[1] Oh boy, I'm stuffed.[0]
{2932}I:
{2933}	 All right![2] Like, this is unreal![1] It's a “Rippin Mushroom”.[3] So I'll give you a “Rock Candy”.[1] Hey thanks a lot![0]
{2933}I:
{2934}	 Whooeee![2] This is most excellent![1] It's a “Flower Mushroom”.[3] I'll give you a “Flower Tab” for it.[1] Hey, thanks, dude.[0]
{2934}I:
{2935}	 See you around, man.[1] Come again, all right?[0]
{2935}I:
{2936}	 Hey you don't have any mushrooms.[0]
{2936}I:
{2937}	      Received a “Maple Syrup”[0]
{2937}I:
{2938}	      Received a “Rock Candy”[0]
{2938}I:
{2939}	       Received a “Flower Tab”[0]
{2939}I:
{2940}	 Would you like an explanation on[1]       how to “Switch” allies?[2]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (No)[0]
{2940}I:
{2941}	 Oh, I see.[2] You're just so well-traveled and[1] experienced, Mario![0]
{2941}I:
{2942}	TOAD: ... and that's how it's done.[2] Now you can get a boost whenever[1] you're feeling tired.[0]
{2942}I:
{2943}	 [12]Uh, now why did I rush back?[1] I had...something to tell you.[0]
{2943}I:
{2944}	 Ack, I remember![2] I came to warn you that Mushroom[1] Way is swarming with monsters![3] I just barely made it back here[1] in one piece![1] Mario, please do something.[3] [12]Perhaps I can help.[1] Do you know about “Timed Hits”?[2]  [7] (No)[1]  [7] (Yes)[0]
{2944}I:	 Ah, ora ricordo![2] Ero venuto ad avvisarti che[1] Strada Fungo brulica di mostri![3] Mi hanno rincorso fin qui![1] Mario, ti prego, fai qualcosa![3] [12]Forse posso aiutarti.[1] Conosci i “Comandi azione”?[2]  [7] (No)[1]  [7] (Sì)[0]
{2945}	 Okay, allow me to explain.[2] First we'll enter a battle.[0]
{2945}I:
{2946}	 Hey, you better watch out![1] He knows about Timed Hits.[3] He's gonna punch your lights out![0]
{2946}I:
{2947}	TOAD: ...and there you are![2] Now, at least you have a fighting[1] chance against those monsters![0]
{2947}I:
{2948}	 That's right![2] We need to tell the Chancellor[1] about Toadstool![3] I'll see you over at Mushroom[1] Kingdom.[3] Just in case, take these with you.[0]
{2948}I:
{2949}	 He's got more bark than bite, huh?[0]
{2949}I:

{2958}I:
{2959}	         Got the “Temple Key”[0]
{2959}I:
{2960}	 You there![1] Rumor has it that you're quite[1] an accomplished jumper.[0]
{2960}I:
{2961}	 I may be out-jumped,[1] but you're totally out-pumped![0]
{2961}I:
{2962}	 ...The strong, silent type, eh?[0]
{2962}I:
{2963}	 Don't you dig these vibes?[0]

{2970}	THE BIG BOO:[1] Check those bubbles[1] coming out of his nose![0]
{2970}I:
{2971}	MONSTERMAMA:[1] So! You wanna go there?[1] Ha! You're an open book![3] Ok, here's what you need to do.[1] There's a secret passage to the[1] sky at...Bean Valley![3] But first you must scale the cliff[1] beyond the desert to get there.[3] Since you're such a nice guy, I'll[1] introduce you to someone that can[1] help you.[0]
{2971}I:
{2972}	MONSTERMAMA: Starbees...?[2] Oh, Star Piece![1] Nope, not familiar with 'em.[3] So you came all the way out here[1] to search for a Star Piece?[1] It must be REALLY important.[3] This is the last place on land.[1] If you can't find it here...[3] [1]       The only place left, is UP![0]
{2972}I:
{2973}	MONSTERMAMA:[1] So what do you think?[1] Isn't our star adorable?[3] She's so talented too![1] Folks come to see her from afar.[0]
{2973}I:
{2974}	MONSTERMAMA:[1] If it's a star you're looking for,[1] there's one upstairs.[0]
{2974}I:
{2975}	MONSTERMAMA: A star, you say?[2] Oh you're here to see OUR star![3] She's upstairs, so feel free to go[1] and take a look for yourself.[0]
{2975}I:
{2976}	MONSTERMAMA:[1] Oh, my! A traveler from afar.[3] Welcome to Monstro Town, where[1] many of our kind mingle.[1] I'm the landlady, Monstermama.[0]
{2976}I:
{2977}	 Yes, just a minute![1] I'll be there in a second.[0]
{2977}I:

{2979}I:
{2980}	GOOMBA: Bowser...[1] It's been ages, hasn't it?[3] Sorry about going AWOL on you.[1] I ran away because I was scared[1] to fight Smithy.[3] A lot has happened since then,[1] but look how far I've come.[1] I'm managing this store now.[3] And look, here are my little ones.[1] Come on, show your manners and[1] greet Uncle Bowser.[0]
{2980}I:

{2981}I:

{2995}I:
{2996}	THE BIG BOO: I'm back![2] You'll never guess my spot![1] It's between “O” and “A”.[3] Our flags are invisible, so search[1] VERY carefully when you think[1] you've found the spot![0]

{2997}	3 MUSTY FEARS:[1] Don't forget what we told you![0]
{2997}I:

{3017}I:
{3018}	SERGEANT FLUTTER:[1] Sky Troopas reporting for duty,[1] MA'AM![3] We're 0.52 seconds late![3] I hold myself personally[1] accountable for the delay, Ma'am![0]
{3018}I:
{3019}	MONSTERMAMA:[1] Still as rigid as ever about your[1] rules and regulations?[3] No need to bother with the[1] protocol around me, Sergeant.[1] I've got a favor to ask of you.[0]
{3019}I:
{3020}	SERGEANT FLUTTER:[1] Yes Ma'am![1] Anything we can do for a civilian.[0]

{3030}I:
{3031}	JAGGER: Bowser![1] I haven't seen you for so long.[3] I've been studying here at the[1] dojo under the Sensei “Jinx”[1] because...[3] To tell you the truth, I...[1] I knew I couldn't beat Smithy.[3] That's why I'm here now.[1] Someday I'm going to return and[1] make you proud![0]
{3031}I:
{3032}	BOWSER: [43][5][43][5]Don't worry about me.[3] I've got new Troopas now, and[1] we're going to take back my castle.[3] You stick to your guns![2] Train like there's no tomorrow![0]
{3032}I:

{3034}I:
{3035}	JAGGER: Great![1] You know that I'm not going to[1] make it easy for you, right?[0]
{3035}I:
{3036}	JAGGER: Yea! I did it![1] I never thought I'd beat Mario![3] You didn't let me win did you?[1] Come back anytime, and we'll try[1] it again if you want.[0]
{3036}I:
{3037}	JAGGER: Yikes![1] I guess that was to be expected.[3] Mario, you're a top-notch fighter![0]
{3037}I:
{3038}	???:[1] You did well for your inexperience,[1] Jagger.[0]
{3038}I:
{3039}	JAGGER:[1] Sensei![1] Have you been here all along?[0]
{3039}I:
{3040}	JINX: Hmmm.[1] You felt my Ki, didn't you?[1] Not bad for a novice![0]
{3040}I:
{3041}	JINX: Your fighting style...[1] It isn't as foolproof as you think.[0]
{3041}I:
{3042}	JINX: Your fighting style...[1] It isn't as foolproof as you think.[0]
{3042}I:
{3043}	JINX: You wish to challenge me?[1]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (No)[0]
{3043}I:
{3044}	JAGGER:[1] Now this should be interesting.[1] Can you beat THE master, Mario?[0]
{3044}I:

{3052}I:
{3053}	JINX: How disappointing![1] Running away during the middle of[1] a match?[3] Come back when you've leveled up[1] sufficiently, and we'll try again.[0]

{3198}	???: Thanks for the help.[1] You really got me out of a jam.[3] Why are you staring at me?[1] You know I'm more than just[1] a doll, don't you?[0]
{3198}I:
{3199}	???: Have you guessed the truth?[12][1] I'm a visitor from above, and this[1] is a form I'm borrowing briefly.[0]
{3199}I:
{3200}	MALLOW: You mean, like, from the[1] sky or something?[0]
{3200}I:
{3201}	???: Higher than that, I'm afraid![12][12][12][2] Do you two know anything about[1] the “Star Road”?[0]
{3201}I:
{3202}	???: Completely in the dark, eh?[12][12][12][1] Well, it's a big mess up there right[1] now, and it concerns you too![12][12][3] Let me explain...[3] You've heard of wishing upon a[1] shooting star?[0]
{3202}I:
{3203}	???: At the “Star Road”, your[1] wish is transformed into a star.[2] When it's granted, it then turns[1] into a shooting star and falls[1] down to earth.[3] So you see, the Star Road plays an[1] integral role in granting wishes.[3] But ever since a sword destroyed[1] the “Star Road”, everything's[1] come to a halt.[3] No stars have been made since.[2] The way things stand,[5] yours is a[1] world where wishes can't come[1] true anymore.[0]
{3203}I:
{3204}	MALLOW: Are you saying THIS star[1] is a part of your “Starway”?[0]
{3204}I:
{3205}	???: That's “STAR ROAD”, my[1] fluffy little friend ...[3] Yes, [5]that star is a broken piece[1] of the Star Road.[3] I'm here to find them all, and[1] repair the Star Road.[0]
{3205}I:
{3206}	???: [1] The broken Star Pieces...[2] There are 7 altogether.[0]
{3206}I:
{3207}	???: For peace to return...[2] we must get rid of Smithy,[1] find the Star Pieces, and repair[1] the Star Road..[0]
{3207}I:
{3208}	???: I'm “[36][37]!?”, but it's hard to[1] pronounce so...[2] Call me “Geno”, after the doll.[3] I chose him because he looked the[1] strongest out of all the dolls.[0]
{3208}I:
{3209}	 “Geno”, who is searching for the[1]  pieces of the Star Road, joins[1]         Mario and Mallow.[3] Things are definitely looking up![0]
{3209}I:
{3210}	GENO: Now grab the star, Mario![0]
{3210}I:
{3211}	 Ooh, I heard everything![12][1] Who would have known that star[1] was so important?[3] I've got to inform Smithy![0]
{3211}I:
{3212}	GENO: Come on![1] Let's get this show on the road.[0]
{3212}I:
{3213}	[1]        Pick up a “Mushroom”[0]
{3213}I:
{3214}	GARDENER: Hey![1] I haven't finished yet.[0]
{3214}I:
{3215}	GARDENER: Short attention span?[0]
{3215}I:
{3216}	GARDENER: Hi, I'm the gardener.[12][12][12][1] See that huge planter?[3] I've spent many years seeking the[1] legendary “Seed” and “Fertilizer”[1] to fill it with, but had no luck.[3] Sigh...if I could only find them![0]
{3216}I:
{3217}	GARDENER: Incredible![1] I can't believe it! It's the[1] legendary “Seed” I've read about[1] in the ancient gardening texts.[1] These are so rare! Can you even[1] begin to comprehend what a huge[1] discovery this is? I've spent my[1] whole life searching for one![1] It's too much, I tell ya![13][24][6]
{3217}I:
{3218}	GARDENER: Egads![1] Do you know what you have there?[1] That fertilizer comes from the[1] Shy Away clan, famous for its[1] miraculous feats of gardening. I[1] looked for it beyond the cliffs,[1] even tried Bean Valley, but failed.[1] I've traveled around the world and[1] waited a lifetime for some of that[1] fertilizer you've got there![13][24][6]
{3218}I:
{3219}	GARDENER: Well, that's my story.[2] Say...will you give me the “Seed”?[1]  [7]  (Sure)[1]  [7]  (Nope)[0]
{3219}I:
{3220}	GARDENER: Yes, you might say I[1] have fertilizer on the brain.[2] Will you give it to me?[1]  [7]  (Sure)[1]  [7]  (Sorry)[0]
{3220}I:
{3221}	GARDENER: You changed your mind?[2]  [7]  (Yes)[1]  [7]  (No)[0]
{3221}I:
{3222}	GARDENER: Well, Mario?[2] Will you give me the fertilizer?[1]  [7]  (Yes)[1]  [7]  (No)[0]
{3222}I:
{3223}	GARDENER: I finally have it![3] This is extraordinary![0]
{3223}I:
{3224}	 May I have the fertilizer?[1]  [7]  (Yes)[1]  [7]  (No)[0]
{3224}I:
{3225}	GARDENER: Sigh...[1] What ever happened to granting[1] an old man's wishes?[0]
{3225}I:
{3226}	GARDENER: Oh thank you![2] I finally have both the “Seed” and[1] the “Fertilizer”.[2] I'll try them out right away.[0]
{3226}I:
{3227}	GARDENER: I'd be so happy if I[1] only had the “Seed”![3] I'm sooo disappointed.[0]
{3227}I:
{3228}	GARDENER: I finally have it![2] But without the “Seed”,[1] it's useless.[0]
{3228}I:
{3229}	 You're giving me the fertilizer too?[1]  [7]  (Yes)[1]  [7]  (No)[0]
{3229}I:
{3230}	GARDENER: Gals don't care for[1] tightwads, you know![0]
{3230}I:
{3231}	FACTORY CHIEF: Mario![12][12][1] I'm surprised to see you here.[0]
{3231}I:
{3232}	FACTORY CHIEF: But this is the[1] end of the line for you.[2] This is the closest you'll ever get[1] to Smithy, so savor the moment.[0]
{3232}I:
{3233}	FACTORY CHIEF: Harrumph![1] You'll be fodder for my incredible[1] invention, the “Gunyolk”![0]
{3233}I:
{3234}	POUNDER #1: Sir![12][12][1] “Drill Bit” will be finished on time.[0]
{3234}I:
{3235}	POUNDER #2: [1]       We're ahead of schedule![0]
{3235}I:
{3236}	POUNDER #3: [1]       We'll make Smithy proud![0]
{3236}I:
{3237}	POUNDER: Here's the report![0]
{3237}I:
{3238}	MANAGER: Good work, everyone.[12][12][12][1] The harder we work, the stronger[1] Smithy will become![0]
{3238}I:
{3239}	MANAGER: The weapons we[1] manufacture here will be...[3][1]           Just think of it...[0]
{3239}I:
{3240}	MANAGER: When Smithy takes over[1] Mario's world, we can do anything[1] we want![0]

{3243}I:
{3244}	MANAGER: It's Mario![2] Mack 2 and Yaridovich 2 didn't[1] stop him?[0]
{3244}I:
{3245}	BOWSER: No, NO! Leave Mario[1] outta this. I'm the one you need[1] to worry about, not him![0]
{3245}I:
{3246}	MANAGER: Mario, you're about to[1] make the longest jump of your life![0]
{3246}I:
{3247}	BOWSER: Y...You're ignoring me![0]
{3247}I:
{3248}	CLERK: [1] Production is on schedule?[3] This, despite the fact that Mack,[1] Bowyer, Yaridovich, and the Axem[1] Rangers were defeated.[2] At this rate, Smithy will have a[1] new army in no time![0]
{3248}I:
{3249}	MALLOW: A...new army?[3] You can't be making more weapons![1] Haven't you caused enough trouble[1] already?[0]
{3249}I:
{3250}	CLERK: What did you say, you[1] little puff ball?[1] [12][12]Mad Mallet! TRASH 'em![0]
{3250}I:

{3252}I:
{3253}	MALLOW: This is THE Mario![3] Give up now, while you still have[1] a chance![3] Shut down production NOW,[1] or he'll...STOMP ya![0]
{3253}I:
{3254}	MALLOW: Ha![1] Hope you learned your lesson![0]
{3254}I:
{3255}	MALLOW: [1] We're almost there, Mario.[2] Come on![0]
{3255}I:
{3256}	MALLOW: What do you suppose[1] this switch does? Hmm...[0]
{3256}I:
{3257}	MALLOW: [1]         Ack! Help me, Mario![0]
{3257}I:
{3258}	MALLOW: [43][12][43][12][43][12]Nothing's happening.[0]
{3258}I:
{3259}	MALLOW: Huh?[1] What's with the funny face, Mario?[3] Oh I KNOW, you're trying to make[1] me look, aren't you?[12][12][1] I'm not going to fall for that one![0]
{3259}I:
{3260}	MALLOW: Boy, that was scary![1] I guess the green switch controls[1] the crane.[0]
{3260}I:
{3261}	GENO: Hmm[43][12][43][12][43][12][2] The production line hasn't halted.[0]
{3261}I:
{3262}	GENO: This must be where Smithy[1] makes his weapons.[3] To find the last Star Piece and[1] stop the factory, we've got to[1] defeat him first.[0]
{3262}I:
{3263}	GENO: Mario...[1] There's no turning back now.[1] Are you ready?[0]
{3263}I:
{3264}	GENO: Our quest is almost over.[0]

{3270}I:
{3271}	DIRECTOR:[1]    I'm afraid that isn't possible. [3] Any dissent against Smithy will be[1] dealt with by immediate melt down.[0]
{3271}I:

{3273}I:

{3296}I:
{3297}	DEALER: In Blackjack, whomever[1] comes the closest to 21 points,[1] without going over, wins.[3] I will first deal 2 cards, then we[1] will each draw as many cards as[1] we wish.[3] Once we stop drawing cards, we[1] both show our hand, and whomever[1] has the higher total wins.[3] But if your hand exceeds 21, your[1] opponent wins, regardless of how[1] many points they have.[3] So if you exceed 21, you'll lose.[3] If I go over 21, you'll win.[3] To play, you'll need 1 Frog Coin.[3] If you win, you'll get 1 Frog Coin,[1] but if it's a tie or you lose, I'll[1] keep it.[3] So how about it?[2] Would you like to play Blackjack?[1]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (No)[0]

{3402}	FROGFUCIUS: [1] That's all the advice I have.[3] You've done well. All that's left[1] to do is to defeat Smithy.[3] Save this world, and bring this[1] quest to a happy end![0]

{3622}I:
{3623}	VALENTINA: Well, we certainly[1] aren't going to listen to your[1] pointless chatter.[3] Frankly speaking, I'm not going[1] to worry. Without this key, the[1] King can't go ANYWHERE![0]
{3623}I:

{3631}	MALLOW: Private? PRIVATE?![1] Everyone in a 10 mile radius[1] could hear you![0]
{3631}I:
{3632}	VALENTINA: Harrumph![1] If you're going to be THIS rude,[1] I'm simply going to leave.[0]
{3632}I:
{3633}	[4][1]          So long...(chumps)![0]
{3633}I:
{3634}	BOWSER: Listen YOU! Never EVER[1] talk to the leader of the Koopa[1] Troop like that! Ooh, I hate...[2] THAT! I'll ignore it this time...[1] but DON'T let it happen again![0]
{3634}I:
{3635}	SHY AWAY: Eh?[12][12][1] Hey! Valentina ran away...[0]
{3635}I:
{3636}	[4][1]      I shall fly the coop, too...[0]
{3636}I:

{3639}I:
{3640}	[1]     It won't open...it's locked.[0]
{3640}I:
{3641}	[1]       Ha! Here's how I'd do it.[0]
{3641}I:
{3642}	[1]       Ha! Here's how I'd do it.[0]
{3642}I:
{3643}	[1]       I'm absolutely exhausted![0]
{3643}I:
{3644}	 I hate being a guard![2] Valentina only gives us the most[1] boring jobs to do!![0]
{3644}I:
{3645}	[1] But I guess this beats Dodo's job.[0]
{3645}I:
{3646}	 Dodo has to polish Valentina's[1] statues EVERY single day![0]
{3646}I:
{3647}	[1]    Now THIS is how I would do it![0]
{3647}I:
{3648}	 You need a key to open the[1] back door of the middle room...[2] But of course, Valentina's got it.[0]
{3648}I:
{3649}	 I used to be a guard here, until[1] Valentina snatched away all my[1] keys...and gave me the boot.[3] Guess I won't be needing this[1] master key anymore...[1] Would you like it?[2] [7]  (Sure!)[1] [7]  (No thanks)[0]
{3649}I:
{3650}	[4] All right, here you go![2] Just don't tell me what you're[1] gonna do with it, okay?[0]
{3650}I:
{3651}	[4] Oh really?, You sure?[1] What a shame[12][12]...this precious key[1] opens the middle room, you know.[0]
{3651}I:
{3652}	[1]     So...you don't want it, huh?[0]
{3652}I:
{3653}	[1]         Wait! Don't say that![0]
{3653}I:
{3654}	MALLOW: To be honest, we really[1] REALLY need it![0]
{3654}I:
{3655}	[1]                Oh, yeah?[0]
{3655}I:
{3656}	[1]    But HE said you didn't need it.[0]
{3656}I:
{3657}	MALLOW: Oh, I'm sorry. You'll[1] have to excuse him, he...he's a[1] little shaken up right now.[0]
{3657}I:
{3658}	[1]      [12]...Oh...[12]Okay...I guess...[12][5][6]
{3658}I:
{3659}	MALLOW: Thank you![2] We owe you one![0]
{3659}I:
{3660}	          Got “Castle Key 1”![0]
{3660}I:
{3661}	 A dip in the hot springs would[1] perk up the King in a jiffy![0]
{3661}I:
{3662}	[1]            Go on, take this...[0]
{3662}I:
{3663}	 Hey! Did YOU know?![2] Valentina's got a huge egg[1] in the middle room.[3] It spits out eggs from time[1] to time, and sometimes when you[1] shield yourself, the eggs'll[2] ricochet off of you.[0]
{3663}I:
{3664}	 Did you know that there are hot[1] springs around here?[2] [7]  (Yep)[1] [7]  (Nope)[0]
{3664}I:
{3665}	[4] Aww, you're no fun.[1] I wanted to be the first[1] to tell you that![0]
{3665}I:
{3666}	[4] We get special hot water from[1] Barrel Volcano. It helps cure all[1] kinds of ailments, but only the[2] King gets to bathe in it.[0]
{3666}I:
{3667}	 Valentina told me to wait in this[1] room... I'm hoping she'll give me[1] a job soon...[0]
{3667}I:
{3668}	 Hey, tell me something,[1] do statues[12][12]...[12]move?[0]
{3668}I:
{3669}	[1]       No. Statues don't move.[0]
{3669}I:
{3670}	[1]        Then[12][12]...[12]explain...[12][12]THIS![0]
{3670}I:
{3671}	 It's...[12][12] one of those hi-tech,...[1] [12]er,...life-like..[12] realistic ones.[1] ...[12][12]Let's get outta here.[0]
{3671}I:
{3672}	GARRO: Why are you back?![2] Come on! Put a little effort into[1] it, okay? Good luck![0]
{3672}I:
{3673}	SHY AWAY: Oh[12][12] Oh[12][12]...[1] ...Busted...[2] What to do, what to do?[0]
{3673}I:
{3674}	 I'll give you this “Fertilizer”[1] if you let me go~...[12][12][12]...OK?[0]
{3674}I:
{3675}	 The hot springs are up ahead,[1] but only royalty can bathe there.[2] And you don't look so royal...![0]
{3675}I:
{3676}	 Right now, Prince Mallow is[1] bathing in the hot springs.[1] It must be so relaxing.[0]
{3676}I:
{3677}	[1]                DANGER!!![1]   Beyond the cliffs is the volcano[0]
{3677}I:
{3678}	QUEEN NIMBUS: Hello, everyone.[2] Thank you so much for looking[1] after my dear child.[0]
{3678}I:
{3679}	QUEEN NIMBUS: Hello, everyone.[2] Thank you so much for looking[1] after my dear child.[0]
{3679}I:
{3680}	[1]        Wait a minute, please...[0]
{3680}I:
{3681}	MALLOW: Please! These people[1] aren't your enemies. They're my[1] friends.[0]
{3681}I:
{3682}	[1]           This way, come on![0]
{3682}I:
{3683}	MALLOW: Mom...[13][48] Dad...[2] I'd like you to meet Mario...[0]
{3683}I:
{3684}	[4][1]...and my other travel companions![0]
{3684}I:
{3685}	KING NIMBUS: I say! How can[1] we ever thank you enough![2] I'm Mallow's father...King Nimbus.[0]
{3685}I:
{3686}	MALLOW:[1]   Allow me to introduce everyone![0]
{3686}I:
{3687}	 This...is Princess Toadstool from[1] Mushroom Kingdom...[0]
{3687}I:
{3688}	KING NIMBUS: Ah![12] I've heard[1] so much about you! May I...[1] have your autograph?[0]
{3688}I:
{3689}	QUEEN NIMBUS:[1]   Don't embarrass junior, dear!![0]
{3689}I:
{3690}	KING NIMBUS: Oh![12]...FANTASTIC![2] (Show me again later...) Eh hem.[1] And WHO do we have over here?[0]
{3690}I:
{3691}	MALLOW: This is Bowser, leader[1] of the Koopa Troop.[0]
{3691}I:
{3692}	KING NIMBUS: Oh! Another famous[1] person! This is just too much![2] I MUST have YOUR autograph![0]
{3692}I:
{3693}	QUEEN NIMBUS: Dear...behave[1] yourself, please![0]
{3693}I:
{3694}	KING NIMBUS: No? Not even a[1] little scribble? Okay, okay...[0]
{3694}I:
{3695}	KING NIMBUS: Yes, yes. I'm quite[1] forgetting my manners...[12][12]Well...[2] ...Who do we have over here?[0]
{3695}I:
{3696}	MALLOW: This is Geno, who I told[1] you about before.[0]
{3696}I:
{3697}	KING NIMBUS: Oh! Yes! That story[1] about the Star Street! How awful![0]
{3697}I:
{3698}	GENO:[1]          That's...Star Road...[0]
{3698}I:
{3699}	QUEEN NIMBUS: By the way, a little[1] before Valentina took over, a[1] large star fell into the volcano![0]
{3699}I:
{3700}	KING NIMBUS: Hmm, but the dreaded[1] “Czar Dragon” inhabits the[1] volcano. It's going to be tough[2] getting a star out of there![0]
{3700}I:
{3701}	[4] Hmmm...perhaps all of you[1] working together COULD handle[1] that beast...[0]
{3701}I:
{3702}	[1] Why, when I was young, I...[0]
{3702}I:
{3703}	QUEEN NIMBUS: Yes, dear...[2] Now, once at the volcano, find[1] Hinopio. He'll be able to help you.[0]
{3703}I:
{3704}	QUEEN NIMBUS: You be careful,[1] Mallow![0]
{3704}I:
{3705}	 Up ahead are the hot springs...[2] But only royalty is allowed...[0]
{3705}I:
{3706}	 Hey! You're the REAL prince![3] Sorry about the misunderstanding[1] before...There's NO WAY that fat[1] bird could have been a Prince, huh?[0]
{3706}I:
{3707}	 MALLOW: No big deal.[2]  Anyway, do you think you[1]  could let us through here?[0]
{3707}I:
{3708}	[1]               Of course![0]
{3708}I:
{3709}	 Go right ahead.[1] Please, enjoy yourselves.[2] But be careful not to fall into[1] the volcano.[0]
{3709}I:
{3710}	 Please, enjoy yourselves.[2] But be careful not to fall into[1] the volcano.[0]
{3710}I:
{3711}	KING NIMBUS: Oh! Nevermind...[0]
{3711}I:
{3712}	[1] And, who is this gentleman here?[0]
{3712}I:
{3713}	MALLOW: THIS[12]....[12]...[12][1] is Mario!!![2] He helped me from the start![0]
{3713}I:
{3714}	KING NIMBUS: I sincerely thank you[1] from the bottom of my heart.[0]
{3714}I:
{3715}	[4] [12]...[12]...[12]You don't mean...[1] THE Mario?! Jumping Mario?![1] Autograph, please![0]
{3715}I:
{3716}	QUEEN NIMBUS:[1]     That's quite enough, dear...[0]
{3716}I:
{3717}	KING NIMBUS: Okay, okay![12][12] Then...[1] how about showing me just a little[1] jump? A tiny hop will do![0]
{3717}I:
{3718}	KING NIMBUS: Son, you're just[1] like me when I was your age.[1] I'm proud of you.[0]
{3718}I:
{3719}	QUEEN NIMBUS: If you have[1] any problems, come straight[2] back, okay?![0]
{3719}I:
{3720}	MALLOW: Okay, mom![2] But I probably won't come back[1] until we find the star![0]
{3720}I:
{3721}	 Go up those steps, and you'll find[1] the royal bus that goes to the[1] volcano. It's pretty cool.[0]
{3721}I:
{3722}	 Do you know about the royal bus?[2] [7]  (Yes)[1] [7]  (No)[0]
{3722}I:
{3723}	[4] It's a regal vehicle, used only[1] by the King. It's parked now, due[1] to the fact he's ill...[0]
{3723}I:
{3724}	[4] When the King recovers, I'll let[1] you see it. You see, I'm the[1] bus maintenance man.[0]
{3724}I:
{3725}	[1]    The bus is undergoing repairs.[0]
{3725}I:
{3726}	CROCO: Say, hey! We meet AGAIN![2] Dis here land is RICH! It's got[1] tons of loot, and I want it all![5][6]
{3726}I:
{3727}	[4] So, youse guys found 'em ALL?[1] ...[12]Geez...[12][12]I've failed...[1][12][12] ...I'm humiliated...![0]
{3727}I:
{3728}	[4] So, youse guys found 'em ALL?[1] ...[12]Geez...[12][12]I've failed...[1][12][12] ...I'm humiliated...![0]
{3728}I:
{3729}	 Welcome! Come on in![1] So you want to take a rest?[1] I'm sure that's why you're here.[3] It'll be [28][1] coins a night.[2] [7]  (OK, I'll take a break)[1] [7]  (I'll pass)[0]
{3729}I:
{3730}	[4] Let me guess...you want to use[1] this “Dream Cushion” to rest,[1] right? That'll be 30 more coins.[2] [7]  (I'll try anything once)[1] [7]  (Looks pretty weird)[0]
{3730}I:
{3731}	[4] Seems like you don't have[1] enough money. Come back again.[0]
{3731}I:
{3732}	[1]              Oh, shut up.[0]
{3732}I:
{3733}	[1]         Don't talk to me now.[0]
{3733}I:
{3734}	 Oh, now look![2] I lost 'cause of YOU![0]
{3734}I:
{3735}	 Wait, hold on![2] This is the highest score...[0]
{3735}I:
{3736}	 Oh, wait,[12] [12]wait[12]...[0]
{3736}I:
{3737}	  All right! YES!![2] ...I'm done here.[0]
{3737}I:
{3738}	 You want this?[1] It's only 500 coins.[2] [7]  (Well, sure!)[1] [7]  (No)[0]
{3738}I:
{3739}	[4][1]              Suit yourself.[0]
{3739}I:
{3740}	[4][1]         You need more coinage.[0]
{3740}I:
{3741}	[4][1]         You need more coinage.[0]
{3741}I:
{3742}	 Want me to teach you?[2] [7]  (Yes, please)[1] [7]  (I already know)[0]
{3742}I:
{3743}	[4][1]          Aww, you're no fun.[0]
{3743}I:
{3744}	[4] High score if you hit[1] the shells with the stars[1] fired from the beetle.[2] If you get hit, recover by firing[1] consecutively...Just do it![0]
{3744}I:
{3745}	[1]   I order you to stand before me.[0]
{3745}I:
{3746}	[1]       I now order you to jump.[0]
{3746}I:
{3747}	[4] In this world, there are things[1] called “hidden treasures”.[2] Use your awesome jumping ability[1] to look for 'em.[0]
{3747}I:
{3748}	[1]    I wish you luck in the future.[0]
{3748}I:
{3749}	 Mario![5][6]
{3749}I:
{3750}	[1] The Chancellor has filled me in![1] Come. Let me show you around.[0]
{3750}I:
{3751}	[1]   Help yourself to the treasures![0]
{3751}I:
{3752}	 If you leave now, what will that[1] do to my reputation?![0]
{3752}I:
{3753}	 This is a “Flower”. The more you[1] gather, the more Flower Points[1] you'll have in battle. [5]Find 'em![0]
{3753}I:
{3754}	 THIS mushroom will restore your[1] Hit Points and Flower Points.[2] Unfortunately, mushrooms you find[1] as items only restore your HP.[2] So beware.[0]
{3754}I:
{3755}	 This is a “Coin”.[1] The small ones are worth one, and[1] the large ones are worth ten.[2] This one's a “10”![0]
{3755}I:
{3756}	[1]          I'm standing guard![0]
{3756}I:
{3757}	 Do you know about Flower Points?[1] [7]  (No! Tell me!)[1] [7]  (Yes)[0]
{3757}I:
{3758}	[4] You sure got your[1] act together, Mario![0]
{3758}I:
{3759}	[4] You sure got your[1] act together, Mario![0]
{3759}I:
{3760}	 We're all able to serve the[1] King again.[3] But we left our houses wide open.[1] Hope everything's all right.[0]
{3760}I:
{3761}	 Came to see the King's statue[1] collection. I tell you, it's[1] remarkable![0]
{3761}I:
{3762}	 Wonder when the bus is gonna[1] start again? They're probably[1] repairing it as we talk.[0]
{3762}I:
{3763}	 Things have finally picked up![0]
{3763}I:
{3764}	 The King's happier than ever[1] after being reunited with Mallow.[0]
{3764}I:
{3765}	 What happened to Valentina?[2] She must have landed near the sky[1] after she flew the coop...[0]
{3765}I:
{3766}	 Morning![1] Did you have pleasant dreams?[5][6]
{3766}I:
{3767}	 Morning![1] Did you have pleasant dreams?[5][6]
{3767}I:
{3768}	[1] That's odd[12]...[12][12][1] It smells like pepper in here![1] Probably just my imagination![0]
{3768}I:
{3769}	[1] It looked like you had nightmares.[1] Is everything okay?[0]
{3769}I:
{3770}	[1] When you hear laughter,[1] you know it's a good dream![0]
{3770}I:
{3771}	[1] You slept quietly, so I'm sure[1] you had pleasant dreams![0]
{3771}I:
{3772}	[4][1]        Please come back again![0]
{3772}I:
{3773}	[4][1]          Kick back and relax![0]
{3773}I:
{3774}	[4] Hey, wait a sec.[1] You don't have enough money, so[1] I can't let you use the cushion.[0]
{3774}I:
{3775}	[4] Good dreams are fun[1] entertainment![0]
{3775}I:
{3776}	 People have been visiting us from[1] the world down under.[2] Even Croco came.[0]
{3776}I:
{3777}	 Croco passed by, earlier.[2] He was saying,“ MINE, ALL MINE!”[1][12] What was that all about?[0]
{3777}I:
{3778}	 I just saw a Mushroom person.[2] You'll find him at the inn.[0]
{3778}I:
{3779}	 We can finally go in the castle.[2] The King seems just fine![0]
{3779}I:
{3780}	 The King must be overjoyed,[1] having Prince Mallow back.[0]
{3780}I:
{3781}	 I'm so relieved the King[1] wasn't ill...[2] And hurrah for our Prince![0]
{3781}I:
{3782}	 Now that we can go into the[1] castle again, I think I'll go check[1] out some statues.[0]
{3782}I:
{3783}	GARRO: Prince Mallow![2] That was splendid work![1] You are every bit a “prince”![0]
{3783}I:
{3784}	MALLOW: If it weren't for you,[1] Garro, we'd never have[1] pulled it off![2] We definitely owe you one![0]
{3784}I:
{3785}	GARRO: Thanks, Mallow.[0]
{3785}I:
{3786}	GARRO: (I'm really glad everything[1] worked out...)[0]
{3786}I:
{3787}	GARRO: Mallow, you ARE indeed,[1] a TRUE PRINCE!![0]
{3787}I:
{3788}	[1]    The royal bus is running again![0]
{3788}I:
{3789}	 Everyone's happy when the[1] weather is nice![0]
{3789}I:
{3790}	 Oh yeah![2] I saw Valentina going towards the[1] building to the south...[2] I wonder why?[0]
{3790}I:
{3791}	MALLOW: Mom![12][12] Dad![0]
{3791}I:
{3792}	QUEEN NIMBUS: Were you able to[1] find the star, dear?[0]
{3792}I:
{3793}	MALLOW: Yeah. The Axem Rangers[1] took it away from us, but...[2] we got it back again![0]
{3793}I:
{3794}	KING NIMBUS: That's wonderful![2] Now the Star, uh[12][12]...Star Thing[1] can be repaired, right?[0]
{3794}I:
{3795}	 I guess not...[12][12]You're...[12][12]still...[1] missing a piece, I take it.[0]
{3795}I:
{3796}	 I guess this is goodbye.[0]
{3796}I:
{3797}	TOAD: Mario![0]
{3797}I:
{3798}	 Are you all right?[0]
{3798}I:
{3799}	 You were kicking up a sweat...[2] Here, drink this and blow those[1] bad guys away.[0]
{3799}I:
{3800}	TOAD: Ya! Ya![0]
{3800}I:
{3801}	 Mario...[2] I've kept this a secret until now,[1] but...[12][12]I'm really[12][12] a...[12][12]a...[0]
{3801}I:
{3802}	[1]              a MONSTER!!![0]
{3802}I:
{3803}	GAZ:[1]    Geno, come on, you can do it![0]
{3803}I:
{3804}	YOSHI:[1]          (Mario! Good luck!)[0]
{3804}I:
{3805}	CHANCELLOR:[1]    We're counting on you, Mario![0]
{3805}I:
{3806}	 Boing, boing, boing![1] I'm trying really hard, so Mario,[1] you have to try hard, too![0]
{3806}I:
{3807}	[1]       I'm with you all the way![0]
{3807}I:
{3808}	[1]    Here it comes, here it comes![0]
{3808}I:
{3809}	 The bus has finally been repaired.[2] We can start operating again.[0]
{3809}I:
{3810}	[1] ..[12]..[12]..[12] Prince Mallow![0]
{3810}I:
{3811}	MALLOW: We want to go to[1] Bowser's Keep...Could you[1] give us a lift, please?[0]
{3811}I:
{3812}	 I've heard the story from[1] King Nimbus.[2] You'll be there in no time![0]
{3812}I:
{3813}	[1]    So, how's the engine running?[0]
{3813}I:
{3814}	[1]   Oh, it's purring like a kitten![0]
{3814}I:
{3815}	 Could you take Prince Mallow[1] to the entrance of Bowser's Keep?[0]
{3815}I:
{3816}	 Of course![12][12] Can't wait to get[1] this thing running again![5][1] Come, Prince, hop on board.[0]
{3816}I:
{3817}	[1]               All aboard![0]
{3817}I:
{3818}	[1]               We're off![0]
{3818}I:
{3819}	       Found a “[26]”![0]

{3823}I:
{3824}	         Got “Castle Key 2”![0]
{3824}I:
{3825}	[4] But hey, I'm not sweatin'![1] This device'll tell me where[1] the treasures are hidden![3] The rest of 'em are mine![1] All MINE!! Adios, fools![0]
{3825}I:
{3826}	 Found a “Signal Ring”![2] If you equip it, it'll ring at[1] the location of a hidden treasure.[0]
